  <h3><font color="#CC0000">INSTRUCTIONS</font></h3>
  <font color="#000000">Just as the machine itself is sent out all ready for immediate 
  use, the bobbin winder also is sent out threaded, and with a half filled bobbin 
  mounted on it, thus practically demonstrating its operation.</font> 
  <p><font color="#000000">Carefully note the mode of threading and impress on 
    your memory the course taken by the thread, viz, it passes from the reel through 
    the slot or eye &quot;a&quot;, between the two tension discs &quot;b&quot; 
    from back to front, and then from front to back, behind the lever, towards 
    its lower bent part, and enters the winder.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">In order to insert a bobbin in the winder, seize the 
    milled head &quot;e&quot; with the forefinger and thumb of the left-hand, 
    and slightly pull it out, place the bobbin between &quot;d&quot; and &quot;c&quot; 
    at the same time jambing the end of the thread between the collar of the bobbin 
    and its seat &quot;d&quot;, and make sure that the little pin in the seat 
    &quot;d&quot; catches into the hole in the brass collar of the bobbin.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Now press firmly with the finger on knob &quot;f&quot; 
    until it has got fixed and no longer rebounds. The winder has now been thrown 
    into gear.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">After disengaging the fly-wheel by undoing the coupling 
    clutch, commence to wind, which will be effected with the greatest neatness 
    and accuracy, as the winder requires no attention whatsoever, but will work 
    quite automatically, and throw itself out of gear of its own accord as soon 
    as the bobbin is sufficiently full. This automatic action renders it possible 
    for the operator to wind a bobbin at the same time while sewing, but it is 
    best to always effect the winding separately because, of course, simultaneous 
    sewing and winding will always make the machine run harder.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">It is necessary to oil the automatic winder a little, 
    from time to time, through the oil-hole near &quot;d&quot;.</font></p>
