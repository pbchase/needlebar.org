  <h3><font color="#CC0000"><b>The Bobbin Winder</b> </font> </h3>
  <p><font color="#000000">When filling the bobbin, pass the cotton between the 
    tension disks. Then draw the cotton through the slit of the flap &quot;a&quot; 
    over the guide into the hole of the bobbin exactly as shown in the illustration. 
    The bobbin is put into the winder by inserting the left point into the piston 
    &quot;b&quot; and the right end (with the hole in it) into the other end of 
    the winder so that the little pin fits into the hole of the bobbin. The cotton 
    should pass through the hole of the bobbin from left to right and be jammed 
    between the latter and the winder (see illustration).</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Now disconnect the movement of the machine and start 
    turning the wheel exactly as done when sewing, press the lever &quot;c&quot;, 
    and the winder is then set in motion, but ceases to work as soon as the bobbin 
    is full.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">In order to remove the filled bobbin easily, press 
    backwards the flap &quot;a&quot; which may remain in this position until the 
    winder is used again when it springs forward by itself. The bent guide over 
    which the thread passes, should be wiped from time to time so that the thread 
    may glide evenly to and fro.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Should the bobbin get too full, turn the little regulating 
    screw &quot;d&quot; to the left, should it not get full enough, turns this 
    screw a little to the right. This regulation is only very seldom wanted as 
    the winder is properly set to fill the bobbin before leaving the factory.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">If the winder does not act properly, it is advisable 
    to ask someone that understands the machine in preference to experimenting 
    with it.</font><font color="#660000"><b><br>
