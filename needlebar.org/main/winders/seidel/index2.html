  <h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000"><b>DOUBLE ACTION BOBBIN-WINDER</b></font></h3>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000000">HAVING placed the reel on one of the 
    spindles, on the top of the arm of the machine, pass the cotton upwards through 
    the wire eyelet (by simply slipping it into it from the back) then over and 
    between the tension discs (c), down towards the winder from behind and under 
    its shoulder-bar towards yourself.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000000">Now, take the bobbin in your right hand, 
    and having threaded the cotton through the little hole in one of its brass 
    ends, place the bobbin in the winder by fitting the little hole through which 
    you have just passed the cotton into the corresponding pin in the right-hand 
    socket of the winder, then place the other side of the bobbin in its position 
    within the left-hand socket, to do which you require to draw out the left 
    piston-button, until you candrop the bobbin into the left-hand socket.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000000">Having now the bobbin properly threaded 
    in its position, press the little lever (a) under the thread pressure plate, 
    which will cause the latter to spring flat against the bobbin; a second pressure 
    against (b) will bring hte India rubber ring in contact with the fly wheel.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000000">Disconnect the fly wheel and put it 
    in motion and the bobbin will begin to fill and will throw itself out of action 
    when full. Should the winder be thrown out of action before the bobbin is 
    full enough, or only when the bobbin is too full, the defect either way can 
    be regulated by means of the screw (f) on the lever (d).</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000000">It is advisable to regulate the screw 
    (f) so, that the bobbin is not allowed to wind too full, otherwise it is apt 
    to jam in the shuttle.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000000">Should the bobbin be only required to 
    be partly filled, the winder can be thrown out of action by simply pressing 
    on the little lever (d) at the bottom of the left-hand side.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000000">Should the India rubber wheel touch 
    the fly wheel too firmly or not firmly enough, the slightest turn of the screw 
    under the winder and facing the operator, will regulate a proper tension between 
    the two wheels.</font></p>
