<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Piedmont sewing machine is known 
  as a badged machine, meaning the manufacturer places the chosen name of the 
  retailer on the machine and can also include the retailer&#8217;s own name, 
  as in this case, the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company. It was also common to see a 
  metal name badge screwed onto the front of the machine, quite often by the retailer 
  when fitting motors and cases. This machine like so many other badged machines 
  at the time was made in Asia, most likely Japan. It is comparable to a Singer 
  15 Class and is known as a HA1 head. It uses a CB (central bobbin) vertically 
  mounted oscillating hook system and takes a 15x1, 705H needle. Low shank presser 
  foot, drop feed and reverse stitch.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="badged2b.jpg" width="550" height="303"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst this type of machine is often 
  referred to as a &quot;Singer clone&quot;, this is really an unfair description. 
  A clone is obviously a copy, but this assertion cannot be justified as improvements 
  were incorporated into the design and were continually developed, such as a 
  hinged rather than a slide cover plate, whereas Singer continued to use a slide 
  plate. Some machines had an integrated sewing lamp such as the Piedmont above, 
  this was never introduced on the Singer 15 Class machines. Other mechanical 
  changes introduced were the Hook Retaining Ring which had two spring loaded 
  retaining clips, making removal of the entire Ring and Hook, easier for maintenance 
  should the Hook tangle with thread. Singer machines had a screw in type Hook 
  Retaining Ring and didn&#8217;t incorporate their hinged style until quite some 
  time later. A Drop Feed Knob incorporating a dual height mechanism enabling 
  the Feed Dog to be lowered completely or set for either fine or heavy fabric. 
  Singer took many years two introduce a similar system. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="badged3a.jpg" width="300" height="300" hspace="10"><img src="badged3b.jpg" width="300" height="295" hspace="10"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="badged3c.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="middle"> 
  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The hinged cover plate and vertical 
  CB Oscillating Hook with the spring loaded retaining ring clips can clearly 
  be seen in the photo to the left. Compare with the Singer slide cover plate 
  and the screw in Hook Retaining Ring shown.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Another worthwhile improvement was 
  the use of a spring loaded Darnamatic used to control the amount of pressure 
  on the presser foot, pressure can be controlled by the press of a button and 
  can also be released completely by pressing a lever or outer ring, whilst Singer 
  continued to use an older style thumb screw.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="badged4a.jpg" width="309" height="282" vspace="20"><img src="badged4b.jpg" width="500" height="331"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The machine on the left shows the 
  Darnamatic control of the type used by the Piedmont example. In the centre is 
  the Singer type thumb screw with the two styles of Darnamatic, Outer Ring and 
  Lever over to the right. This simple improvement combined with the drop feed 
  control gave this machine an ease of use never experienced on Singer 15 Class 
  machines of the same period.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="badged5a.jpg" width="300" height="312" hspace="10"><img src="badged5b.jpg" width="410" height="312" hspace="10"></font><font face="Comic Sans MS">

</div>
<p align="justify">In the early days these machines were normally exported as 
  heads only and were fitted with locally produced carry case, motor and foot 
  control, thus eliminating the need for electrical authority approval. <br>
  Badging of machines was and still is to some degree in common practice around 
  the world today with major companies such as Montgomery Wards and Sears Roebuck 
  in the US. Sears alone imported 274,000 Japanese machines in the first six months 
  of 1969. John Lewis (Jonelle) and Woolworths (Winfied) in the UK. David Jones, 
  Myer and Empisal in Australia. These companies would often buy from different 
  manufacturers as prices were highly competitive for large volume purchases. 
  This also makes identifying manufacturers of badged machines even more complicated. 
  Common names used at the time were Crown, Liberty, Queen and Victor, quite often 
  including the words Deluxe or Super Deluxe, Precision etc.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="badged6a.jpg" width="350" height="263" hspace="10"><img src="badged6b.jpg" width="350" height="263" hspace="10"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="badged6c.jpg" width="350" height="274" hspace="10" align="absmiddle"><img src="badged6d.jpg" width="450" height="338" hspace="10" align="absmiddle"><br>
</p>
</font> 
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">A direct comparison of the Piedmont 
  machine and other Asian Badged Machines can clearly be seen in the above photos, 
  lower right is a Singer machine showing the Simanco Trademark. Singer protected 
  its trademarks vehemently, it still does to this day. Note also differences 
  in the Bed Plates between the Asian made machines and the Singer product, the 
  ribbing which is used for strengthening the casting is particularly obvious 
  and can clearly be seen in these photos. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Research into Asian made machines 
  and their respective companies is in its infancy and is only just getting underway, 
  as yet not a great deal is known. Many different companies manufactured these 
  machines in huge numbers over a long period of time. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">For example, in the late 1950&#8217;s 
  there were more than 300 Japanese companies involved in the industry, with 125 
  manufacturing sewing machines. By the end of 1969 only 25 companies were actively 
  manufacturing machines, and accessory suppliers had likewise decreased to a 
  handful. Yet despite the trend, production and export from Japan increased dramatically, 
  supplying over 50% of all sewing machine sales in the USA in 1969.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Although mass produced it should 
  be noted that these Japanese heads were extremely well built, they performed 
  well, were very affordable and the finish was second to none. Machines came 
  in various and some very bright colours making them very attractive to collectors 
  of this type of machine today. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The technical improvements that 
  these manufacturers introduced not only caused Singer to take notice but forced 
  them to follow, eventually adding similar features themselves. These machines 
  evolved into more modern designs, squarer in appearance, with easier to use 
  features such as a dial type stitch length knob and push button reverse, eventually 
  giving way to the side loading zig zag machine. This development utilised the 
  same side loaded CB Hook system as the HA1, which was adapted enabling the entire 
  hook race to move from left to right in time with the movement of the needle 
  during the zig zag stitch. This development preceded the beginning of a whole 
  new era in sewing machine technology and the eventual demise of several western 
  manufacturers. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst rumours persist that the 
  Piedmont in particular is a re-badged Singer 15 Class machine and or having 
  been made from Singer parts, which were supposedly purchased from the Singer 
  factory in Kilbowie Scotland, when it closed down, this story has been seized 
  upon and embellished by online sellers over the years, obviously it makes these 
  machines seem more desirable and collectable, thereby generating higher prices. 
  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">To quote The Hudson&#8217;s Bay 
  Company Heritage web site, Frequently Asked Questions. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we do not manufacture anything 
  ourselves, we are strictly retailers. That being said we have for centuries 
  retailed exclusive products manufactured to our own specifications &#8211; particularly 
  our world-famous HBC point blankets. Over the years our house or &#8220;private&#8221; 
  brands have included china, tobacco, tea and coffee, etc. Today they are primarily 
  apparel and house wares.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The facts are: </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. These machines were sold long 
  before the Kilbowie plant closed down which was in June 1980. <br>
  2. Parts manufactured by Singer were stamped with either the SIMANCO (Singer 
  Manufacturing Company) trademark or the word Singer and a part number.<br>
  3. None of the Piedmont machines have been discovered with any such Singer trademark. 
  <br>
  4. No pre-drilled holes on the front of the pillar where the Singer badge would 
  have been placed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you have purchased one of these 
  badged machines then you have a reliable sewing machine which is well built. 
  And in the case of our Piedmont example, it has a connection to one of the world&#8217;s 
  oldest retailers, The Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company.</font></p>
