  Industries, Guide Bridge, UK)</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font color="#660000">The origins of Brother Industries 
  date back to 1908 when the Yasui Sewing Machine Company was established for 
  parts production and sewing machines repairs. </font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>In 1925 the name of the company 
  was changed to Yasui Brothers Sewing Machine Company in recognition of the role 
  of Masayoshi Yasui and his brother Jitsuichi Yasui as managers of the company. 
  </strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>Production of the first Brother 
  industrial sewing machine began in 1928 and the first domestic prototype model 
  being made in 1932. </strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>With the incorporation of the 
  company in Nagoya, on 15th January 1934, full production of Brother sewing machines 
  began. </strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>In 1954 twenty years later, the 
  company began production of knitting machines and with exports of Brother products 
  growing rapidly, Brother International Corporation (Japan) was established to 
  handle overseas sales. </strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>At the same time Brother International 
  Corporation (US) was set up in New York with responsibility for the sale of 
  Brother products in the United States. </strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>Entry into the business machine 
  market began in 1961, when the first Brother typewriter was produced. </strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>It was obvious that for the continued 
  growth of the group as a whole, some means would have to be found of entering 
  into the massive European market.</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong><br>
  To this end a decision was taken in 1958 to set up a sewing machine production 
  plant in Dublin, Ireland. </strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>At that time Jones Sewing Machine 
  Company was second only to Singer in terms of manufacturing and sales within 
  the UK and they seemed an ideal stepping stone for further penetration of the 
  European market. </strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>This of course prompted the decision 
  to acquire the company for the marketing of Brother sewing machines, and the 
  Jones + Brother Company was set up in 1968.</strong></font></p>
