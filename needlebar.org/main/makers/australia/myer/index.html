<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Sidney Myer arrived in Melbourne in 1899 
  as a penniless Russian immigrant and ended up creating one of the largest retail 
  businesses in Australia.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">He and his brother worked briefly at a 
  drapery store in Flinders Lane before moving to Bendigo where they opened the 
  first Myer store in 1900. They continued to prosper and opened another Myer 
  store in 1908.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">In 1911 Sidney bought a drapery store 
  in Bourke St, Melbourne. After buying up a number of the adjoining properties 
  he built a department store on the site called Myer Emporium.<br>
  </font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">After establishing himself in Melbourne, 
  Sidney expanded the business setting up in Adelaide and later across Australia.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">In 1920 he married Merlyn Baillieu, the 
  22 year old daughter of an established Queenscliff family. Not only did Sidney 
  Myer achieve great business success, he also became a leading philanthropist.</font></p>
