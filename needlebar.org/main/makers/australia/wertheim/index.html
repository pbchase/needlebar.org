    Brief History of the Wertheim Sewing Machine Company</span></b></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>The Wertheim 
    Sewing Machine Company was founded in 1868 by Joseph Wertheim (1804–1899) 
    in Frankfurt, Germany. At this time Joseph was the Frankfurt city delegate 
    for the Democratic Party of which he was a long serving member.  At its height 
    the Wertheim factory employed approximately 650 workers. The company used 
    a trademark of a dwarf holding a hammer which is known to have been used until 
    at least 1925, however in 1909 a Star of David was also registered.</span></font></p>

    in Frankfurt, Germany</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>In 1870 a subsidiary 
    was formed in Barcelona, Spain under the Wertheim name.  Complete machines 
    were imported and sold. <span style='text-transform:
uppercase'>A</span>mongst these was the English Jones machine, locals began calling 
    the sewing machines “las rapidas”, and the business became known as “las casa 
    de las rapidas”.  </span></font></p>

    in San Martin, Barcelona, Spain</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>In 1915 production 
    of a totally manufactured Spanish Wertheim machine was commenced.  Wertheim 
    Germany continued manufacturing machines until 1932 when the Wertheim family 
    fled and moved to Spain.  Despite converting to Christianity from Judaism, 
    they feared the political unrest in Germany during that time.  Wertheim Spain 
    which became Rapida SA was now the sole manufacturer of the Wertheim machine.  
    The factory was managed by Karl Wertheim under the alias Carlos Vallin. </span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"> <font face="Comic Sans MS">Wertheim serial numbers for Superba 
    start with S6. Wertheim's reincarnation of Singer models began with an S serial 
    number. Until his sixth attempt Wertheim models were not particularly successful 
    in the public's eyes. Machines bearing S6 are likely to have begun being been 
    produced sometime between 1880 and 1890, S6 machines were manufactured until 
    approximately 1915.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#CC0000" face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU><b>Hugo Wertheim 
    (1854-1919)</b></span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>Hugo Wertheim 
    was born on 12<sup>th</sup> July 1854 at Lispenhausen, in the German electorate 
    of Hesse-Kessel, son of Meyer Wertheim and his wife Minna, née Heinemann.  
    Meyer was the cousin of Joseph Wertheim.  </span></font></p>

  <p align="center"><font color="#000099" face="Comic Sans MS">Hugo Wertheim 1914, 
    Bronze Plaque by K. Korschmann, Frankfurt</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>It is unknown 
    whether Meyer was involved in the sewing machine industry.  Hugo was trained 
    in business and developed a good commercial sense.  There is some confusion 
    in the articles read as to whether Hugo was sent overseas by Joseph, or whether 
    he had made it clear he had no intention of staying in Frankfurt.  However 
    it is</span> <span
lang=EN-AU>known that Hugo went overseas to act as an agent for the Wertheim Sewing 
    Machine Company, leaving for Australia aboard the Great Britain, arriving 
    in Melbourne in October 1875.  He began advertising from premises at 39 Flinders 
    Lane East as an agent for Wertheim Sewing Machines, quickly establishing himself 
    as a merchant. On the 27<sup>th </sup>February 1882 Hugo was </span><span lang=EN-AU>naturalized 
    becoming an Australian citizen.</span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>Returning to 
    Germany he married Joseph Wertheim’s daughter Sophie Emile (1864-1953) on 
    the 30<sup>th</sup> August 1885 at Frankfurt and the couple came to Melbourne 
    to live. They returned to Europe frequently over the years.  Hugo built a 
    substantial </span></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>business 
    selling sewing machines, knitting machines, bicycles, pianos, mangles, cream 
    separators, washing machines and baby carriages under brands such as Wertheim, 
    Electra, Planet, Griffin and Hapsburg.  He actively promoted his business 
    and was known for elaborate displays at agriculture shows and in 1901 at the 
    Pan American Exposition, Buffalo, United States of America.  </span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>During the 1880’s 
    he built a 17 bedroom mansion, Gotha (later Hadleigh Hall, demolished 1935), 
    at South Yarra, where musicians such as the visiting Paderewski played.           
                         </span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>Wertheim’s Queensland 
    business set up a showroom in Queen Street Brisbane near Custom House.  They 
    sold and serviced pianos and sewing machines there until the late 1920’s. 
    In 1903 he opened new retail premises at 294-296 Burke Street and 175 Chapel 
    Street Prahran, with head offices at 171-173 William Street and in South Australia 
    at 107 Rundle Street Adelaide. About this time Jeff Kennett’s (former Victorian 
    Premier 1992-1999) great grandfather pointed out that it was pianos, not sewing 
    machines that were in short supply in the new world.    With no expertise 
    in piano manufacture he sent his eldest son Herbert to learn the trade in 
    America.  Hugo prepared for his son’s return by ploughing £75,000 into a piano 
    factory on four acres of land at 22 Bendigo Street Richmond.  Hugo’s investment 
    was of such significance that Prime Minister Alfred Deakin laid the factory’s 
    foundation stone on the 21<sup>st</sup> October 1908.  Alfred Deakin observed 
    that ‘few men with such opportunities for a life of ease would have embarked 
    on such an enterprise… the first in Victoria to commence making pianos’.  
    Theodore Fink </span><span lang=EN>(politician, newspaper proprietor and educationist) 
    </span><span lang=EN-AU>remarked that Wertheim had left behind the controversial 
    position of an importer and grown into the patriotic position of a manufacturer.  
    Premier Sir Thomas Bent, to reported cheers, said that he found him as good 
    a Briton as any in promoting industry. Hugo Wertheim was an unassuming man 
    but did nothing by halves, commissioning architect Mr Nahum Barnet, who had 
    worked for Steinway, Bechstein, Kaps and others, to design a prestigious factory 
    that compared with the best in the world.  The result was an imposing 50,000 
    square red brick factory, producing 2,000 pianos, including twelve grands 
    per year.  The factory employed 300 people and manufactured all parts of the 
    many types of pianos on offer, predominately from Australian materials.  The 
    Wertheim piano enjoyed such acclaim that Dame Nellie Melba is said to have 
    refused to perform with anything else.</span></font></p>
