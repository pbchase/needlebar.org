    <font color="#660000"><strong>Octavius Charles Beale was born in 1850 in Ireland. 
    At four he travelled with his mother to Australia to join his father and brothers 
    in Van Diemen's Land. At 9 he returned to Waterford to continue education 
    before joining a Melbourne hardware firm at the age of 16. At 23 he set up 
    a branch in New Zealand, returning to Melbourne as a partner two years later. 
    His wife Elizabeth Baily was to bear him 13 children. After she died in 1901 
    he married her sister Katherine in 1903. </strong></font></p>
</div>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>After a brief association with 
  Hugo Wertheim, Beale established his piano and sewing machine importing company. 
  He remained as Managing Director until he was killed in a motor accident in 
  1930. These early pianos sold by Beale were called Hapsburg Beale.</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>In 1893 he opened a piano factory, 
  which produced everything needed for piano manufacture. He had his own brass 
  and iron foundries, introduced and patented his important all-iron tuning system. 
  Beale pianos can be dated by serial number.</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>Veneer was first produced in Australia 
  by Beale &amp; Co in 1907, using a sawing method which was later replaced by 
  slicing. Queenland walnut was the major wood used. Beale stressed that the woods 
  used in his pianos were best suited to the climates of Australia.</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>It is unclear whether Beale made 
  or bought in sewing machines. It seems more likely that they were bought in 
  for re-sale. He did, however, manufacture cabinets and cases for sewing machines, 
  and also for Singer in Australia.</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>Beale travelled widely and as 
  a Royal Commissioner delivered a report on the decline of the birth rate, its 
  moralistic and racialist bias had to be toned down before publication. He also 
  reported on drugs and patent medicines, was a keen botanist and possessed a 
  wide knowledge of Australian woods.</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>Beale became a founding President 
  of the Federated Chamber of Manufacturers of Australia, President of the NSW 
  Chamber of Commerce, trustee of the Australian Museum and the Bank of NSW, Fellow 
  of the London Royal Historical Society, and the Royal Society of Arts and was 
  granted freedom of the City of London, as a liveryman of the Company of Musicians.</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>Beale's mother had started a small 
  Quaker school in Hobart, which amalgamated into The Friend's School, this is 
  still operating. Although brought up a Quaker, he became fascinated by Freemasonry, 
  becoming an Anglican and Mason.</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>The company may have been taken 
  over by Ralph Symonds in 1960, then Paling &amp; Co in 1961. It ceased production 
  in 1975.</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><strong>Beale pianos are still manufactured 
  in China using Beale's methods under the name of Pearl River, in association 
  with Yamaha.</strong></font></p>
