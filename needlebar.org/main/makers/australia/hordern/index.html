<h2 align="center"><font color="#CC0000"><b>Anthony Hordern &amp; Sons Ltd</b></font></h2>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">Sydney, NSW</font></b></h3>

<h4 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">(Information courtesy of NSW Heritage 
  Office and Chris Clark)</font></h4>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The Anthony Hordern retail dynasty had 
  humble beginnings; Ann Hordern's stay-making business developed into a drapery 
  and millinery shop at the front of her King Street house.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Husband Anthony's coach building business 
  was at the rear. The business prospered into a fully fledged department store, 
  with The New Palace Emporium opening in 1905, after the previous building had 
  burnt down in 1901. (It has been said that the store was based on the principles 
  of Whiteleys in London).</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">By the 1920s they operated a mail order 
  department and employed over 3,000 employees. The Anthony Hordern Building and 
  Pavilion were built in 1924.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The History of Anthony Hordern Limited 
  was written by J J Redmond and published in 1938, the 115th anniversary of the 
  shop. It was a revised and enlarged History of the House of Anthony Hordern, 
  first published in 1932.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">For the Anniversary year, 50,000 oak seedlings 
  were imported from England in celebration of Anthony Hordern's anniversary. 
  Sydney is still dotted with many of these trees.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The most famous surviving oak was planted 
  by Kathleen McGill in 1938 at the Oaks Hotel, Neutral Bay on Lower North Shore. 
  The current hotel owner distributed further seedlings on the tree's 60th birthday, 
  continuing the Hordern theme &quot;While I live, I'll grow&quot;.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The company was taken over by Waltons 
  in 1969 and de-listed in 1970.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">In 1985 Lesley Hordern published &quot;Children 
  of One Family. The Story of Anthony &amp; Ann Hordern and their Descendants 
  in Australia 1825-1925.&quot;</font></p>
