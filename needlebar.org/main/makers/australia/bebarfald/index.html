<p align="center"><strong><font color="#660000">All sewing machines were imported. 
  Bebarfald was the sole agent in Australia for Vickers from England and also 
  supplied machines from National in America and other German manufacturers (possibly 
  including Wertheim). They produced their own sewing machine cabinets from Australian 
  wood and iron bases, with a range of over 90 different styles, more than any 
  other Australian company.</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font color="#660000">&quot;Bluebird&quot; tea sets 
  and thimbles were used as enticements to purchase sewing machines. Bebarfald's 
  were so confident that their machines were the finest available that they offered 
  &pound;5 to anyone offering a practical improvement that they accepted.</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font color="#660000">The glass fronted Orvieto cabinet 
  was introduced in the 1920s.</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font color="#660000">Mona Moncrieffe of the Bebarfald-Bluebird 
  Sewing Machine Department compiled two books for purchasers of Bebarfald machines 
  in the 1920s &quot;The Better Dress-Maker&quot; and &quot;The Magic of Colour 
  Harmony in Dress&quot;.</font></strong></p>
