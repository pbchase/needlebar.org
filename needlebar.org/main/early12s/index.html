  <p><b><font color="#660000">It is widely reported in various texts about early 
    sewing machines, that Singer's New Family or Model 12 machine began to be 
    produced in 1865. New evidence presented here shows that this is incorrect, 
    and it is now known that the first Model 12s were produced in 1863.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#660000">The Singer 'New Family' machine was devised and 
    designed by James Bolton, an employee of the Singer Company, who at the time 
    was in charge of the Singer office in Chicago, Illinois. </font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#660000">In his diary he relates how he made the first prototype 
    in Chicago, which he then sent to the Singer Company in New York, but when 
    this machine was shown to Isaac M. Singer, Isaac told the company they should 
    take a sledge hammer to it! Following this rather disconcerting critical assessment 
    the project was shelved.</font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#660000"><b>Undeterred, and maybe in a somewhat spiteful mood, 
    James Bolton took the machine to Singer's rival Elias Howe, in the hope that 
    he would purchase or manufacture the design. In the event Howe didn't buy 
    it, and claimed he didn't have the necessary funds available to produce it, 
    though he did express the opinion to Bolton that &quot;it might prove a good-selling 
    machine&quot;.</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000"><b>However, eventually the Singer Company turned away 
    from their proposed 'sledge hammer' strategy and decided to put the fledgling 
    Model 12 into production. This seems to have happened for two reasons; first, 
    the Singer company had heard that maybe Howe would take it up, and second, 
    the control of the company at the time was passing from Isaac to the board 
    members after the incorporation of the Singer Manufacturing Company, and this 
    'young blood' was keen to produce something new. </b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000"><b>These events are not dated in Bolton's diary, but 
    could not have been before 1863, because Bolton mentions Hopper as president 
    of the Singer Company, and Hopper took up this position in 1863.</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000"><b>The first machine we wish to discuss is Serial # 
    86040, which dates to 1863, and is the earliest Model 12 we are aware of.</b></font></p>
  <p><img src="graphics/86040.jpg" width="600" height="318"></p>
  <p><b><font color="#660000">Note the extremely primitive bobbin winder arrangement 
    which is fixed to the wooden treadle table. See also the raised ridge which 
    runs from left to right along the center of the bed.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font color="#660000">This machine does not bear the name 'Singer' anywhere, 
    but it can be identified from a couple of fortuitous pieces of evidence. The 
    first are some pictures from a doctoral thesis written by Dr. David Hounsell, 
    who dismantled several early Singer machines as part of his research at the 
    Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC. The earliest machine shown is the 
    underside of #87104, which also dates to 1863. As can be seen there are sufficient 
    points of similarity to the underside of #86040 to say that the latter is 
    definitely a Singer machine.</font></b></p>
  <p><img src="graphics/86040-87104.jpg" width="600" height="675"></p>
  <p><b><font color="#660000">Another verifying piece of evidence is a small advertisement 
    showing a Singer Model 12 machine and treadle base which is identical to that 
    of #86040.</font></b></p>
  <p><img src="graphics/86040ad.jpg" width="843" height="590"></p>
  <p><font color="#660000"><b>As mentioned above, this machine has a raised ridge 
    which runs the length of the bed. It also has a strange arrangement of the 
    slide plates which would cause problems in use. Imagine the shuttle becoming 
    jammed in the race to the right of the needle in this machine. Whenever this 
    happened it would be necessary to remove the left hand slide plate and the 
    stitch plate before the right-hand plate could be removed to give access to 
    the jammed shuttle.</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000"><b>It is likely that Bolton attempted to solve this 
    problem by machining down the ridge in the needle and shuttle-race area almost 
    down to the level of the bed, and fitting a large slide plate over this area 
    which also doubled as the stitch plate. This new arrangement can be clearly 
    seen on a Model 12 machine which was made about three years later than the 
    first.</b></font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#660000">This second machine is #153198, and dates to 1866.</font></b></p>
  <p><img src="graphics/153198.jpg" width="720" height="441"><br>
  </p>
  <p><font color="#660000"><b>This new slide/stitch plate arrangement will have 
    caused fresh problems however, particularly fouling of the needle and tangling 
    of the threads when being removed, not to mention the ease with which paintwork 
    could be scratched given the small amount of clearance for the plate under 
    the needle and presser foot. </b></font></p>
  <p><img src="graphics/86040-153198beds.jpg" width="529" height="513"></p>
  <p><font color="#660000"><b>An alternative solution was found when it was realised 
    that if the bed casting were to be changed, with the ridge to the right of 
    the shuttle race lowered to the level of the bed, then the right-hand slide 
    plate could be removed without disturbing the stitch plate or the left-hand 
    slide plate. The date of introduction of this new bed casting is unclear, 
    but it was certainly present by 1871 as machine #853603 below shows, so the 
    date of its introduction can be narrowed down to some time between 1866 and 
    1871. This change can be narrowed down still further by machine #816716 which 
    has the new casting <em>(Information courtesy of Dave King)</em></b></font></p>
  <p><img src="graphics/853603.jpg" width="600" height="507"></p>
  <p><font color="#660000"><b>Apart from a later modification to round off the 
    corners of the right-hand end of the bed ridge, this became the familiar final 
    slide plate arrangement and was used until the Model 12 was phased out of 
    production in the late 1890s after having been by far Singer's most popular 
    machine to that date. </b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000"><b>The last batch of Model 12 machines left Singer's 
    Kilbowie factory in Scotland in 1902.</b></font></p>
