    TOOLS &amp; MATERIALS FOR RESTORATION</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello again, sewing machine people, 
    and welcome once more to the Needlebar pages on sewing machine restoration. 
    In this article, I&#8217;m going to be talking about some of the tools and 
    materials that we will be using as we restore the machines in our collections. 
    We will also take a look at the skills that are desirable if we are going 
    to be able to produce good quality work (don&#8217;t worry &#8211; most of 
    these are easily learned) and the workshop facilities &#8211; or lack of them 
    &#8211; that we will be working in. Firstly, however, let&#8217;s talk about 
    wood. This is a bit lengthy, but it&#8217;s important to have at least a basic 
    understanding of the material that we will be working with.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">THE PROPERTIES OF WOOD -</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">No &#8211; I don&#8217;t mean 
    wooden houses - I mean the attributes of the stuff and how it behaves &#8211; 
    or misbehaves &#8211; under various conditions.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&#8220;Wood is a living material!&#8221; 
    How many times have you heard that old chestnut (if you&#8217;ll pardon the 
    pun)? Complete and utter rubbish! Not only is wood dead once the tree&#8217;s 
    been chopped down, most of it&#8217;s dead whilst the thing&#8217;s still 
    growing! The only part of a tree that&#8217;s ever actually alive (apart from 
    the leaves and this year&#8217;s new shoots) is a thin layer of cells, just 
    behind the bark, called the cambium. The cambium layer sub-divides each year, 
    the outer cells forming the bast or phloem (inner bark), which conducts the 
    tree&#8217;s food &#8211; but is dying, and will shortly become the new outer 
    bark (dead). Towards the inside of the tree, the sub-division of the cambium 
    forms the next annual ring of sapwood, which conducts moisture and stores 
    nutrients - but is actually dead. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So why do some people describe 
    wood as &#8220;a living material&#8221;? Well I suppose it&#8217;s because 
    it moves and changes shape, swelling and contracting even hundreds of years 
    after it has been made into a piece of furniture. This movement is caused 
    by the pores of the wood taking in, or giving out, moisture, in a similar 
    manner to a sponge (which is also dead!). If you put a sponge into a bowl 
    of water, it&#8217;ll absorb water until the moisture level inside it is the 
    same as that in its surroundings. Likewise, if we take our now saturated sponge 
    out of the bath, it&#8217;ll release water until the balance with its surroundings 
    is again achieved. Wood does exactly the same thing with the moisture in the 
    air. This is often referred to as the wood &#8220;breathing&#8221;.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">People talk about &#8220;feeding&#8221; 
    wood with (say) oils or wax. Well you can&#8217;t feed it for the same reason 
    that it can&#8217;t breath &#8211; it&#8217;s dead! What oil, wax or various 
    other finishes actually do is to seal the pores, thus reducing the wood&#8217;s 
    ability to absorb or exude moisture. Finishes also help prevent airborne fungal 
    organisms from entering the wood and causing it to deteriorate. It should 
    be understood at this point that wood doesn&#8217;t just deteriorate or decay 
    all by itself &#8211; rot is the result of the wood fibres being eaten by 
    a fungus &#8211; thus, no fungus, no deterioration.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wood has a grain, and this is 
    what makes it more complicated to work with than just about any other material. 
    Those pores that we&#8217;ve been talking about are actually tiny tubes - 
    millions of them - that carry moisture and nutrients up the tree by capillary 
    action. They obviously all run in the same direction (i.e., up - no more clues) 
    and are what form the grain of the wood. Any piece of wood is simply a bundle 
    of these tubes, and the direction in which the tubes (i.e., the grain) are 
    running is the single most important factor when we&#8217;re deciding how 
    to work with a particular piece of timber.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let&#8217;s try to make this a 
    bit easier to visualise. Imagine holding a bundle of drinking straws in your 
    hand. If you take a thin, blunt blade in your other hand and press it against 
    the top of the bundle, it&#8217;ll easily slide down between the straws, splitting 
    the bundle. If, however, you press your blade against the side of the bundle, 
    it&#8217;ll go nowhere. Pressing harder will cause the straws to crush &#8211; 
    but the blade still won&#8217;t go through them. The only way to cut through 
    the straws from the side is to use either a very sharp blade or a saw. Wood 
    behaves in exactly the same way; place the bluntest of blades on the end of 
    the grain and hit it &#8211; the wood will split easily along its grain. Push 
    the blade against the side of the grain as hard as you like; the wood will 
    only crush unless the blade is very sharp indeed (or a saw is used).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">A BASIC LAW OF 
    WOODWORKING:</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> - The time when wood is most 
    likely to split along its grain is when you really didn&#8217;t want it to!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">At this point, it would be worth 
    mentioning the relationship between the grain of the wood and the way in which 
    moisture causes it to swell. Wood reacts to moisture the same way that we 
    react to meat and potato pies, i.e., we get wider but we don&#8217;t get any 
    longer. Thus - </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">ANOTHER BASIC 
    LAW OF WOODWORKING:</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> - Wood swells and contracts 
    across the grain. Changes in moisture make only a miniscule difference to 
    the length (along the grain) of a piece of wood, but the effect on the width 
    (across the grain) can be considerable.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Don&#8217;t underrate the ability 
    of wood&#8217;s to absorb moisture. A growing tree is quite likely to be 50% 
    water by weight. The wood in your furniture will be around 8-12% water (depending 
    on the temperature and humidity in your house). It&#8217;s quite capable of 
    absorbing water &#8216;till it gets back to the level it held when it was 
    growing. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"> <font face="Comic Sans MS">&#8220;So what&#8217;s all this 
    got to do with sewing machines?&#8221; I hear the masses howling! Well, quite 
    a lot, especially when we start to look at some of the peculiar things that 
    veneer will do on treadle stands. Veneer is wood with a grain, just the same 
    as any other wood &#8211; and it reacts to moisture changes in exactly the 
    same way. If you just remember that ALL wood swells and contracts across the 
    grain and not along it, you&#8217;ll be halfway to understanding and solving 
    the sorts of problem that we&#8217;ll be dealing with later in this series.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There&#8217;s just one final thing 
    that we need to mention before leaving the subject of wood, and that is &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">CUTTING WOOD THE WAY IT WANTS 
    TO BE CUT &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is one of the most important 
    things for you to understand, because if you don&#8217;t humour the wood, 
    it&#8217;ll soon let you know, and show its disgust by ruining the appearance 
    of your work! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&#8220;But I&#8217;ve no intention 
    of cutting any wood&#8221; I hear you wail, &#8220;I just want to improve 
    the appearance of my sewing machines!&#8221; Oh that life could be so simple! 
    &#8220;Cutting wood&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean setting about it 
    with saws and chisels; whenever you are scraping off an old finish, sanding 
    the wood with abrasive paper or even rubbing the surface with wire wool, you 
    are cutting wood, and if you don&#8217;t do it right &#8211; it&#8217;ll show. 
    Get it wrong with veneer, and it&#8217;ll really show &#8211; and break your 
    heart in the process! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Life could be so sweet if only 
    every piece of wood had a dead-straight grain that ran exactly parallel to 
    the outside edge. The reality is that the grain more often than not has a 
    slightly wavy shape (the degree of which is dependant on the variety of tree 
    and the conditions in which it grew). Those guys at the sawmill are paid by 
    the ton of wood cut, so they aren&#8217;t going to spend too much time checking 
    that the grain is exactly aligned with their saw-blade when they convert a 
    tree trunk into boards for sale.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So how does the wood like to be 
    cut? Well, if we&#8217;re cutting across the grain with a saw, it doesn&#8217;t 
    really make a great deal of difference how we do it, but most of the time 
    we&#8217;ll be working (smoothing) the surface in line with the grain.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We&#8217;ve already said that the 
    grain will rarely be exactly parallel with this edge; it will usually be running 
    slightly diagonally, at a very shallow angle. The picture of part of a 1937 
    Singer cabinet shows this quite well.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/GrainAngle.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The (English oak) grain is clearly 
    visible and you can see that, all the way along the side of the wood, there 
    are the ends of these grain &#8220;tubes&#8221;, lying much like the hairs 
    on the back of a smooth-coated dog. Now we all know what happens when we stroke 
    a dog: if we stroke from head to tail, the hair stays flat and the animal 
    enjoys it, but if we stroke in the other direction, the animal&#8217;s coat 
    looks very ruffled and the critter is not impressed! Well, wood&#8217;s just 
    the same. If we were to run a sharp blade down the edge of the wood in the 
    direction in which the grain is laying (left to right in the picture), we&#8217;ll 
    take a nice clean shaving with very little effort, leaving a smooth finish 
    (the wood&#8217;s way of smiling) on the surface. If, however, we try to take 
    a shaving in the other direction (right to left in the picture), the blade 
    will chatter along the surface of the wood as it digs into the ends of the 
    grain and instead of a nice smooth finish, we&#8217;ll have lots of little 
    craters where we&#8217;ve dug lumps out of the surface.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Most of the other things that 
    you&#8217;ll need to know about the behaviour of wood, we can mention when 
    the time arrives during our restoration projects. I will, however, just dispel 
    one more myth.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There are two types of wood, known 
    as &#8220;hardwood&#8221; and &#8220;softwood&#8221;, all species fitting 
    into one or the other category. So &#8220;hardwood&#8221; is hard and &#8220;softwood&#8221; 
    is soft - right? &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Wrong! The two titles have little to 
    do with the hardness of the wood. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There are two types of tree &#8211; 
    those with broad leaves that (usually) drop off in the autumn (fall) and those 
    with needle-shaped leaves that (usually) don&#8217;t drop off. The former 
    are &#8220;hardwoods&#8221;, and include oak, ash and elm, which are pretty 
    hard; mahogany, which can be anything from very hard (Cuban) to pretty soft 
    (Brazilian), and balsa, which is about as tough as a wet newspaper. The trees 
    with needle-shaped leaves are &#8220;softwoods&#8221; and include fir and 
    pine, which are pretty soft, spruce, which can be fairly hard, and yew, which 
    is harder than most &#8220;hardwoods&#8221;. Hey! - I don&#8217;t make the 
    rules, I&#8217;m just telling you how the song goes!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">TOOLS FOR RESTORATION &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We can keep this pretty simple. 
    You will need a small selection of flat-bladed screwdrivers of various lengths 
    and widths. If you buy them as you need them, you&#8217;ll not waste money 
    on ones you&#8217;ll never use. A reasonable size of adjustable spanner (wrench) 
    may also prove useful &#8211; one about 8 inches (200 mm) long will do nicely. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">You&#8217;ll need a selection 
    of abrasive cloths or papers. I mainly use a cloth-backed, aluminium oxide 
    type known as &#8220;J-flex&#8221;, but you can take your pick from the millions 
    of types available. Get a selection of different &#8220;grits&#8221;&#8211; 
    I would suggest that 180, 240, 320 and 400 grit would cover all of our needs. 
    Those numbers represent the coarseness of the abrasive: the bigger the number, 
    the finer the grit &#8211; thus 400 grit will give the smoothest finish whilst 
    180 grit will remove a lot of wood very quickly (if you&#8217;re not careful!). 
    I would also recommend buying ones with a soft cloth backing rather than paper, 
    because they&#8217;re less likely to put scratches were you don&#8217;t want 
    them.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There&#8217;s a good reason for 
    not wanting to sand away the surface of the wood unless we&#8217;re forced 
    to. Over time, wood develops a &#8220;patina&#8221;. This is a change of colour 
    that occurs on the surface of the wood and is caused by the action of sunlight. 
    It gives the wood that mellow appearance which separates the antique from 
    the starkness of a newly made object. As a general rule, light coloured woods 
    become darker and dark woods become lighter. <img src="pics/Patina.jpg" width="640" height="480" vspace="10"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The picture shows a vase I made, 
    possibly a couple of years or so ago, from beech that was almost paper white. 
    Look at the colour now, after two years in our conservatory. What colour will 
    it be in 100 years time? The patina is only on the surface. If I were to cut 
    away four or five thousandths of an inch of the wood (easily done with abrasive 
    paper), it would be white again. Lesson: &#8211; don&#8217;t go mad with the 
    abrasives! Sometimes we&#8217;ll have to abrade through the patina &#8211; 
    but we&#8217;ll avoid it where we can.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The thing we&#8217;ll use more 
    than anything else is steel wool (wire wool). The version you&#8217;ll all 
    have seen is the stuff your plumber uses to clean copper pipes before he solders 
    fittings into place. This is &#8220;medium&#8221;, or grade 1 and we&#8217;re 
    unlikely to have much use for it in our restorative exploits. It does, however, 
    have a coarse cousin (haven&#8217;t we all?), which can be very handy for 
    helping us to removing old shellac from woodwork, or paint from treadle stands.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
    - At this point I would comment that I consider the removal of the original 
    paint from treadle stands to be &#8220;a restoration too far&#8221; in the 
    vast majority of cases. I&#8217;ve only done it once: on a fairly rare 1890s 
    &#8220;Vertical Feed Sewing Machine Company of London&#8221; machine, (the 
    British version of the Davis Vertical Feed) which had been heavily modified 
    at some time in its past. This restoration necessitated me having to extensively 
    fabricate new metal parts for the stand, to replace the original parts that 
    had been disposed of during the modifications. In addition, the original paint 
    on the stand was completely rotten and was crumbling away as powder. I personally 
    consider that most iron stands, even if 50% of the original paint is missing, 
    look better just cleaned and polished up than repainted. However, I accept 
    that not everyone will share my opinions; so later on in this series of articles 
    I will cover the subject of how to repaint a stand without it looking as though 
    you&#8217;ve just done it. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"> Back to wire wool. &#8220;Coarse&#8221; 
    wire wool is grades 2 or 4 (4 being the coarsest, but 2 will be just dandy 
    for what we want to do), but the really useful stuff for us restorers is 0000 
    grade (said as &#8220;four noughts wire wool&#8221;). This is at the opposite 
    end of the range from the coarse grades and it really is like cotton wool 
    &#8211; so soft it&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s made from steel. I get 
    through tons of it! If you have a problem finding shops that sell 0000 (or 
    2, for that matter), try suppliers of wood finishes or companies selling equipment 
    for wood-turners. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The only other items you&#8217;re 
    going to need in the near future are a couple of scrapers &#8211; the type 
    you use for removing old wall paper; some (cheap and cheerful) two inch (25 
    mm) paintbrushes for applying varnish stripper and some protective clothing; 
    mainly eye-shields and thick, non-absorbent gloves &#8211; kitchen rubber 
    gloves are OK but you can buy the proper heavy-duty items from builder&#8217;s 
    supplies shops very cheaply indeed.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The two scrapers I use most are 
    about an inch (25 mm) and about two inches (50 mm) wide &#8211; the exact 
    size isn&#8217;t critical. These will require a modification: you will need 
    to slightly round off the two corners to prevent them from digging into the 
    veneer when you are stripping the old finish from our woodwork. Either grind 
    them or file them, but make sure that the final result is very smooth so as 
    not to scratch the wood. If you have neither a grinder nor a file, use some 
    of your newly bought abrasive &#8211; it&#8217;ll be harder work but it&#8217;s 
    important that we get rid of those sharp corners. It will also be worthwhile 
    rubbing your abrasive all the way along the working edge to round it slightly 
    and ensure there are no sharp bits. Check for smoothness with your fingers. 
    If it feels smooth &#8211; it is. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There&#8217;s sure to be some 
    other things that we&#8217;ll need, but I can&#8217;t think what they are 
    at the moment, so I&#8217;ll mention them as the need arises.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">MATERIALS FOR RESTORATION &#8211; 
    </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Again, we&#8217;re not going to 
    need a lot to get us started but we will be adding to the list as we progress. 
    At this point it&#8217;s worth mentioning that common, everyday items have 
    different names in different countries. I&#8217;ll try to give the United 
    Kingdom and American names, and assume that the rest of the English-speaking 
    world uses one name or the other. For those of you for whom English is not 
    the native tongue, I&#8217;m afraid you may have to decide for yourselves 
    what the translation is.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So here&#8217;s your shopping 
    list: -</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"> Methylated spirits (America &#8211; 
    de-natured alcohol)<br>
    White spirits (America &#8211; mineral spirits)<br>
    Raw linseed oil (boiled linseed oil will do &#8211; but raw is better)<br>
    Vinegar (ordinary malt &#8211; the stuff for fish and chips!)<br>
    Paint/Varnish stripper<br>
    Pearl glue (also called Scotch/Hide/Animal &#8211; used hot)<br>
    French Polish (Button polish).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now as soon as we use the term 
    &#8220;French Polish&#8221;, we start to get into deep water, so I&#8217;ll 
    try to clarify a few points - and destroy a few myths in the process.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">French polishing is a process, 
    not a material. The material used is shellac; a natural resin exuded by an 
    insect found mainly on the Indian sub-continent, called the lac beetle. The 
    shellac is dissolved in methylated spirits (de-natured alcohol) to create 
    a lacquer. An item that has been &#8220;French polished&#8221; has had this 
    lacquer applied in a particular way, i.e., by the French polishing process. 
    Items that have been finished with the same material applied by a different 
    technique have been &#8220;lacquered&#8221;, but are not &#8220;French polished&#8221;. 
    Confused? You will be!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lacquer made in this way was in 
    use in this country (England) as far back as the early 17th century, but French 
    polishing, using exactly the same material, didn&#8217;t appear in England 
    until around 1815 (don&#8217;t let anyone tell you that Chippendale used French 
    polish &#8211; he used shellac lacquer but he knew no more about French polish 
    than it knew about him!).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The woodwork on our sewing machines 
    is not French polished, but it is shellac lacquered. Pretty well any glossy 
    wood finish applied pre-1950 (or thereabouts) will be shellac-based. We don&#8217;t 
    know how the different versions of these finishes were applied by the different 
    manufacturers, but sewing machines were being turned out by the million, so 
    they definitely weren&#8217;t French polishing them, because it&#8217;s a 
    slow process. It&#8217;s almost certain that the lacquer manufacturers would 
    formulate shellac-based finishes to suit the processes favoured by the individual 
    companies making woodwork for sewing machines &#8211; quite likely some sort 
    of spraying process (don&#8217;t try spraying ordinary French polishing lacquer 
    yourselves &#8211; I&#8217;ve tried it &#8211; half of it dries in the air 
    between the spray-gun and the wood and the vapour is seriously explosive!).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There is a product on the market 
    known as &#8220;Brushing French Polish&#8221;: a shellac lacquer that can 
    be applied with a brush, but looks like French polish. I don&#8217;t want 
    to bore you with a lengthy explanation as to why &#8211; but avoid it.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Stains were often used to make 
    cheap woods look like mahogany, I have proved by my own experiments on the 
    finishes of a great many sewing machines that the stains were always in the 
    lacquer and were not applied to the wood first.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we don&#8217;t know the 
    formulations or application methods used all those years ago &#8211; and if 
    we did, would be most unlikely to be able to replicate them, we must aim to 
    reproduce the original appearance as accurately as we can, using materials 
    as similar as possible to the originals.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst I have emphasised that 
    French polishing is a process, the material used is nowadays sold as &#8220;French 
    Polish&#8221; (?). You can buy the shellac flakes to dissolve in alcohol, 
    but it&#8217;s more convenient to buy it made up and ready to use. It&#8217;s 
    available in various colours, the main ones being Garnet (the darkest colour), 
    Button, Orange and White. The Garnet is too dark for most of the items that 
    we&#8217;ll be working on and the Orange is too orange to be of much use for 
    anything! The most useful for us is the Button polish (darkish), although 
    I do also buy White for mixing with Button if I need a slightly lighter finish 
    (usually on late 1950s machines).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We will be applying the lacquer 
    by a process that is basically similar too &#8211; but a much-simplified version 
    of - French polishing. Don&#8217;t start reading books about French polishing; 
    they&#8217;ll frighten you to death! I&#8217;ll show you all you need to know 
    for our purposes. Trust me! <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#0000FF">FACILITIES FOR RESTORATION &#8211;</font></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a workshop measuring 24 
    feet by 20 feet that contains more machines and power tools than I can remember 
    and more planes, chisels, saws, woodcarving gouges etc., etc., etc. than you 
    could shake a stick at! Who&#8217;s a lucky boy, then? I&#8217;m very aware 
    that some of you eager beavers will have nothing more than the kitchen table 
    to work on. Don&#8217;t worry. For most of the work that we&#8217;ll be doing, 
    the kitchen table (preferably moved outside the back door) will be just fine. 
    For the benefit of those of you lucky enough to have a dedicated workshop, 
    we may in the future tackle one or two jobs that require slightly better facilities, 
    but if you&#8217;ve already got those facilities, you&#8217;ll most likely 
    not need me to tell you anything anyway, so this series will be aimed primarily 
    at the &#8220;kitchen table fusiliers&#8221;.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">And finally &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">THE SKILLS REQUIRED FOR RESTORATION 
    &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the film &#8220;Magnum Force&#8221;, 
    the &#8220;Dirty Harry&#8221; character, played by Clint Eastwood, kept using 
    the expression &#8220;a man&#8217;s got to know his limitations&#8221;. I&#8217;m 
    not convinced he was talking about sewing machine restoration, but he might 
    as well have been. Listen to the man! Be constantly aware of the limitations 
    of your skills and you&#8217;ll save a lot of antiques from destruction!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">HOWEVER &#8211; </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Limitations are there to be got 
    rid of. Some people are more naturally dexterous (&#8220;good with their hands&#8221;) 
    than others, but most, if not all of the skills that we&#8217;ll need can 
    be acquired by anyone who&#8217;s prepared to practice and be patient. All 
    I&#8217;m saying is: don&#8217;t start trying to re-paint the ceiling of the 
    Sistine Chapel until you&#8217;ve mastered drawing a duck. It&#8217;s very 
    easy to get carried away by your enthusiasm &#8211; and very hard to rectify 
    the damage afterwards. The single golden rule for success in restoration is 
    the same as it is for being good at absolutely anything else &#8211; attention 
    to detail. Take your time; listen to what your Uncle Fenman tells you; and 
    if something goes wrong, stop - strip it off - and start again. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, guys and gals &#8211; in 
    the next article, we&#8217;ll be getting our hands dirty. I&#8217;ve said 
    a lot of things that may have made you feel somewhat cautious &#8211; and 
    were designed to do so &#8211; but don&#8217;t let them put you off having 
    a go. Just make sure your brain is at least ten minutes in front of your hands! 
    &#8220;If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it!&#8221; Don&#8217;t restore 
    machines that don&#8217;t need restoring &#8211; but if a machine&#8217;s 
    in a sorry state, give it some tender loving care &#8211; it deserves it. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So good luck, think what you&#8217;re 
    doing, don&#8217;t use your rarest and most valuable machine for your first 
    attempts &#8211;and enjoy it.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">And here, just to whet your appetites, 
    is a picture of the big feller (that&#8217;s me) unloading the game-cart after 
    a hunting trip into the fens.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"> <img src="pics/Hunting1.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The day&#8217;s bag &#8211; a late 
    1930s Vesta VS111 portable by L.O. Dietrich and a very ornate 1907 Stoewer 
    treadle, both in need of some serious tender loving care, and both featuring 
    most of the restoration problems that you&#8217;re likely to encounter. (I 
    wonder how many people see the big &#8220;S&#8221; logo on a Stoewer and think 
    it&#8217;s a Singer &#8211; it&#8217;s an easy mistake to make). They&#8217;re 
    a couple of typically German products &#8211; nicely engineered, very pretty 
    appearance and certainly worthy of restoration &#8211; so that&#8217;s what 
    we&#8217;ll do.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">NOTE:</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
    - Whilst Vestas are sometimes difficult to date accurately; I was able to 
    date the Stoewer by using the information in &#8220;Mr Needlebar&#8217;s Dating 
    Book&#8221;. This publication is absolutely essential for any serious auction-lurker 
    or antique shop-alligator like myself and I would strongly advise anyone who&#8217;s 
    collecting vintage sewing machines to get themselves a copy (see the home 
    page for details). Whilst there are several good books available on the subject 
    of antique and vintage sewing machines, this is the only one that&#8217;ll 
    go in your top pocket! The latest issue contains dating info for Baer &amp; 
    Rempel, Elias Howe, Florence, Frister &amp; Rossmann, Grover &amp; Baker, 
    New Home, Opel, Pfaff, Singer, Stoewer, Wheeler &amp; Wilson and Wilcox &amp; 
    Gibbs &#8211; phew! - Got to be worth a few pounds, dollars, euros or whatever 
    you use locally to keep the wolf at bay! All financial contributions that 
    you give in return for a copy are used to help pay for the bandwidth needed 
    to make this site available to you all &#8211; and that&#8217;s money well 
    spent. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the next article, we&#8217;ll 
    see what we can do to improve the Vesta VS111 &#8211; and learn a few skills 
    in the process.</font></p>
