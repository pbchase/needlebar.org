  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">STEP FIVE &#8211; 
    SANDING</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211; </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><u>CHECKING FOR 
    UNDERSTANDING</u></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211; I&#8217;ll be 
    using the expression &#8220;sandpaper&#8221; because I suspect that most of 
    our readers will be American. As I mentioned earlier when I was talking about 
    screws, our good buddies in the land of dollars and sense tend to use broad-brush 
    expressions, i.e., &#8220;setscrew&#8221; meaning any one of a whole range 
    of fixings, and will tend to call any one of the thousands of available sheet-abrasives 
    &#8220;sandpaper&#8221;, whilst British woodworkers tend to be somewhat more 
    specific in describing the product they&#8217;re using and will rarely, if 
    ever, use that expression &#8211; but they know what it means.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the trivia question is &#8211; 
    when was paper coated with sand as the abrasive last sold commercially in 
    Britain? The answer, believe it or not, is that it was never made or sold 
    commercially in this country! Many abrasives have been used, but sand was 
    never one of them. So why do we call it sanding? Search me! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I tend to use cloth-backed aluminium 
    oxide abrasives for most of my work &#8211; usually the type marketed as &#8220;J 
    flex&#8221;. It&#8217;s vastly superior to the old glass-paper that seems 
    to have been around since Pontius was a pilot: it doesn&#8217;t clog-up so 
    easily and it remains sharp for a very long time. The downside is that it&#8217;s 
    expensive. I buy it in 4- inch (100mm) wide rolls and it costs around 2 UK 
    pounds a metre. The good news is that you don&#8217;t have to buy a 50-metre 
    roll - you can buy it by the metre, and one metre will do an awful lot of 
    work. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you can&#8217;t get J flex, 
    don&#8217;t worry &#8211; any reasonably soft, cloth-backed abrasive will 
    be OK, but try to avoid paper-backed products or the industrial ones backed 
    with rigid fabric. They have their uses &#8211; but this isn&#8217;t one of 
    them. Paper-backed abrasives are mainly used on flat surfaces and can cause 
    unnecessary scratches when used on curves. Having got that clear &#8211; it&#8217;s 
    &#8220;sandpaper&#8221; from now on, guys!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We&#8217;re going to be sanding 
    two sorts of surfaces: flat ones and curved ones. When we sand the flat surfaces, 
    we&#8217;ll wrap the sandpaper around a flat piece of wood for a backing, 
    whilst when we sand the curves, we&#8217;ll use our hand for a backing. If 
    we DON&#8217;T use a block on the flat surfaces, we&#8217;ll tend to sand 
    them into curves. If we DO use a block or the curved surfaces, we&#8217;ll 
    tend to sand them flat. Get it? </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Mask.jpg" width="525" height="700"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh no! I&#8217;m as bald as a 
    badger&#8217;s backside! Note that in the picture, I&#8217;m using a flat 
    block to back the sandpaper, because I&#8217;m sanding a flat surface. This 
    is actually a proper, cork-faced sanding block, but any really flat object 
    will do.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">You&#8217;ll notice I&#8217;m 
    wearing a mask. This is for two reasons: to stop me inhaling wood dust and 
    to prevent my bank manager from recognising me. We&#8217;re only going to 
    be sanding this very, very gently indeed, as I&#8217;m trying to avoid going 
    through any patina that the wood&#8217;s acquired, but we&#8217;ll still produce 
    a small amount of wood dust. Inhaling any sort of wood dust ain&#8217;t good 
    for you: inhaling the dust from tropical hard woods REALLY ain&#8217;t good 
    for you, and can induce nasty respiratory problems! Wear a dust mask!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I&#8217;m sanding with 320 or 
    400 grit sandpaper just sufficiently to get the surface really smooth and 
    to remove the slightly glazed effect left by the stripping process.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><u>NOTE &#8211; ALWAYS SAND IN 
    THE DIRECTION OF THE WOOD GRAIN. THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS 
    RULE - EVER</u>.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Sandingcurve.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Here I&#8217;m sanding a curve, 
    so I&#8217;ve folded the sandpaper double and am using my thumb as the backing 
    as I stroke the sandpaper over the curves, And before you all start jumping 
    up and down, shouting &#8220;he hasn&#8217;t got a mask on!&#8221; - that 
    orange electrical cable behind my left hand is running to the thing that you 
    can&#8217;t see and most likely haven&#8217;t got where you&#8217;re working 
    - a filthy great big 0.5 micron filtered dust-extraction unit hanging from 
    the ceiling that&#8217;s nearly sucking my shirt off! You just make sure you&#8217;re 
    wearing your masks!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Once I&#8217;d finished the sanding 
    (took me about five minutes or so), I gave the whole cover a wipe over with 
    a soft brush and then a clean rag to get rid of the dust, and then retired, 
    with the cover, to the house &#8211; we&#8217;ve finished the dirty part of 
    the job now, and I want to get away from the dusty environment to a very clean 
    one.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">DUST FREE</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
    &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">NOTE &#8211; From this point onwards, 
    we will need to be in a very clean and dust-free environment. There&#8217;s 
    very little smell from the shellac, so I&#8217;d strongly suggest that you 
    do this in the house. Any dust at all could spoil your work. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Although I carefully wiped all 
    the dust off the cover before I left the workshop, it still isn&#8217;t clean 
    enough, so I&#8217;m now going to wipe it all over with a tack-cloth (tack-rag). 
    These are readily available from the companies selling wood finishes, but 
    if you have problems getting one, you can make your own thus &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a piece of soft cotton cloth, 
    soak it in water and ring it out to dryness. Now sprinkle a little white spirits 
    (mineral spirits) onto it and rub the cloth hard onto itself so that you end 
    up with it distributed all through the cloth. Now do the same with some linseed 
    oil; sprinkle a little on and rub it until it&#8217;s distributed right through 
    the cloth. It&#8217;s now ready to use. The bought ones do actually feel tacky, 
    whilst the homemade ones do not &#8211; but they still work OK. Whether you 
    bought it or made it, wrap it in a plastic bag or place it in a small, airtight 
    jar when you&#8217;re not using it and it will keep for quite a long time 
    (I used one for this job that I&#8217;d made about six or eight weeks before, 
    and it was fine).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wipe over the whole of the surface 
    with your tack-cloth very lightly &#8211; don&#8217;t apply any pressure. 
    Do this as much as possible in the direction of the grain. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We are now going to begin the 
    very satisfying process of applying a new finish &#8211; and will then perform 
    secret and mystical rites that will ensure that it doesn&#8217;t look as though 
    it&#8217;s brand new. We will do these using materials that are substantially 
    the same as the originals and above all, we will not do anything that&#8217;s 
    not reversible.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">OILING THE WOOD</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
    &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The first thing we&#8217;re going 
    to apply is a coat of raw linseed oil. Wipe it on fairly liberally with a 
    cloth. After a couple of minutes or so, take a close look at it. In some places, 
    the surface may look dry again, &#8216;cos the stuff&#8217;s soaking in, whilst 
    in other places, it just sits on the surface, smiling back at you. This uneven 
    absorption &#8211; or lack of absorption &#8211; often happens and is not 
    a problem &#8211; just give it another fairly liberal coat of the stuff straight 
    away. Now let it stand for about 15 minutes, during which time it will almost 
    certainly be absorbed unevenly &#8211; but don&#8217;t worry - just leave 
    it alone. At the end of this period, wipe all the excess oil off the surface 
    with a clean cloth.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Oiled.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">It should now look something like 
    this. Very pleasing!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Two items posing a very real danger 
    of spontaneous combustion now confront us. The first is the linseed oil soaked 
    rags and the second is Linda when she sees this photograph and realises that 
    I was doing this on her SuperQuilter table while she was out!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><u>SERIOUS SAFETY WARNING</u> 
    &#8211; Rags soaked in linseed, tung or any of the other oils used by woodworkers 
    can &#8211; and often do &#8211; burst into flames of their own accord, sometimes 
    many hours after use. Don&#8217;t leave them lying around and don&#8217;t 
    throw them into a bin. Either burn them yourself somewhere safe, or if you 
    can&#8217;t do that, wash them out well and spread them out flat to dry before 
    disposing of them. You&#8217;ve been warned!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let the case now stand for at 
    least 24 hours and then buff it all over, quite firmly, with a clean cloth. 
    (If you ever, for any reason, use pure tung oil instead of linseed oil, let 
    it stand for about four days before buffing). </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">A HAVEN FOR THE 
    FAINT HEARTED</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211; </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The next stage is applying the 
    shellac and cannot exactly be described as &#8220;dead simple&#8221;. Most 
    people will, with a little bit of care and concentration, manage it just fine, 
    but there will be someone among you right now who is conscious of not being 
    the most &#8220;handy&#8221; person in the world &#8211; you wouldn&#8217;t 
    describe yourself as &#8220;dextrous&#8221; - not born to perform card tricks 
    &#8211; you are to hand crafts what someone with two left feet is to dancing 
    &#8211; no-one ever lets you hold their baby - you&#8217;re cack-handed (another 
    fenland expression).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"> If this is a good description 
    of you, don&#8217;t despair &#8211; all is not lost! Read the rest of the 
    article, and if you then think, &#8220;I can do that!&#8221; then go for it, 
    but if you feel the colour draining from your face and really don&#8217;t 
    have any confidence whatsoever in your ability to do it, then simply apply 
    a couple of coats of a good quality furniture wax polish (real wax polish 
    - not aerosol!) at this stage and buff it to a nice sheen. Job done! Finito 
    Benito! End of story! It&#8217;s not exactly authentic, but it looks nice 
    and, more importantly, it&#8217;s reversible if someone in the future wants 
    to do the proper job. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If, however, you&#8217;re confident 
    that you have a modicum of dexterity, press on.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">FOR THE (REASONABLY) 
    STOUT HEARTED &#8211; APPLYING SHELLAC</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> - 
    </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Please read the next section several 
    times and be sure you fully understand it before proceeding. It&#8217;s not 
    rocket science; it&#8217;s not particularly difficult; but you do need to 
    have it clear in your mind before you start.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The thing that makes the application 
    of shellac a little tricky is the speed at which it dries &#8211; instant! 
    (A slight exaggeration &#8211; but we&#8217;re talking seconds rather than 
    minutes). This means that the luxuries one enjoys with paint, like being able 
    to brush it out until it looks nice, don&#8217;t apply with shellac, so we 
    have to use a totally different technique for applying it. Don&#8217;t be 
    frightened &#8211; this is going to sound a lot more difficult than it actually 
    is: but if you&#8217;re at all nervous, practice first on a piece of scrap 
    plywood, MDF (fibreboard) or similar. If you really do make a total pigs-ear 
    of it, you can always get the stripper out and start again, heart breaking 
    though that would be!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The first thing we have to do 
    is to make a &#8220;fad&#8221; or &#8220;fadder&#8221; (and there were you 
    thinking that a &#8220;fadder&#8221; was an Irish Catholic priest). For this, 
    you&#8217;ll need a piece of reasonably fine, white cotton cloth about 6 inches 
    (150mm) square. Now before the French polishing purist among you starts jumping 
    up and down, shouting &#8220;you make a fad out of upholstery wadding&#8221; 
    let me remind you of what I said before &#8211; we ain&#8217;t French polishing 
    &#8211; we&#8217;re faking an old shellac finish. Trust me and do as I say! 
    You also need some cotton wool.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><u>CHECKING FOR UNDERSTANDING</u> 
    &#8211; Cotton wool - I&#8217;m sure the American contingent has a different 
    name for this &#8211; and I can&#8217;t remember what it is &#8211; but I&#8217;m 
    sure you&#8217;ll recognise it from the picture. It&#8217;s the stuff you 
    ladies wipe your make-up off or dry a baby&#8217;s bottom with.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Openfad.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Place the cotton wool in the middle 
    of the fad, as above. We are now ready to &#8220;charge&#8221; the fad. To 
    do this, we need some French polish.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I&#8217;m using the type of French 
    polish known as &#8220;button polish&#8221; which is eminently suitable for 
    all sewing machines until we get onto the teak-effect ones of the late 1950&#8217;s 
    &#8211; which need something a little lighter. If the bottle you find in the 
    shops is just labelled &#8220;French Polish&#8221; and the stuff in it is 
    a dark brown colour &#8211; it&#8217;ll be button polish, but if it&#8217;s 
    labelled something like &#8220;Dark French Polish&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;ll 
    be too dark.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Shake the bottle very well. You 
    may be able to see solids that have settled in the bottom of the bottle: keep 
    shaking until these have all dissolved again. We charge the fad by pouring 
    shellac into the cotton wool thus &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Chargefad.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The picture above is slightly 
    deceptive in that it was taken after I&#8217;d actually been using the fad 
    for a while, so it looks as though it&#8217;s awash with shellac (you can, 
    by the way, see the colour of the button polish very well here). Don&#8217;t 
    overdo it; just pour it on until there looks to be a reasonable amount soaked 
    into the cotton wool. Note &#8211; if you make the fad too big, you&#8217;ll 
    use up a bottle of shellac just charging it! Keep the fad reasonably small 
    &#8211; when you gather the edges of the cloth together, it should (for this 
    particular job) be no bigger than a golf ball &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Closedfad3.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pour a small depth of shellac 
    into a small dish (I used the one that you can see in the bottom right-hand 
    corner of the above picture), dip the fad into it and scrape-off the surplus 
    shellac quite firmly on the edge of the dish. Now press the face of the fad 
    against a piece of clean paper (the stuff you use in your printer is ideal). 
    This is to distribute the shellac evenly in the fad, but also to ensure that 
    the fad isn&#8217;t too heavily charged. The fad should leave an evenly coloured, 
    light brown mark on the paper. If parts of the mark are much darker than the 
    rest, there&#8217;s too much shellac on the fad, so scrape it off hard against 
    the rim of the dish again.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Dippedfad.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We are going to apply the shellac 
    very thinly indeed. As we wipe the fad across the wood, we will be looking 
    to leave a stripe of wetness with very little shellac in it. An analogy would 
    be to imagine wetting a piece of cloth with water and then wringing it out 
    just as hard as you possibly can, until it barely feels damp at all, then 
    wiping it across a piece of glass &#8211; it would leave a wet mark which 
    would have so little water in it that it would evaporate away in seconds.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Initially, the wood may soak-up 
    the shellac, so we&#8217;re going to apply about three coats (the exact number 
    of coats is never critical at any stage of this process) working as much as 
    possible in the direction of the grain and with each stroke JUST overlapping 
    the previous one.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There will be one or two places 
    where we can&#8217;t go with the grain &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Incorner.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">That corner is as awkward as can 
    be &#8211; but we&#8217;ve got to get it &#8211; so I&#8217;m pushing a bit 
    of the fad into it with the tip of my finger and wiping across the grain before 
    quickly going back along the same bit doing short wipes in the same direction 
    as the grain. Look closely to make sure you&#8217;ve got it right into the 
    corner if your cover&#8217;s got a tricky bit like this.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">You will notice I&#8217;m doing 
    this without any sort of hand protection, so I&#8217;ll get shellac and alcohol 
    on my skin. I&#8217;ve never seen anyone, amateur or professional, ever try 
    to do this job whilst wearing gloves, nor do they use any sort of barrier 
    cream on their skin, because there must be no greasiness there whatsoever 
    (I wash my hands every few minutes when I&#8217;m doing this sort of work, 
    simply to keep the skin&#8217;s natural oils at bay). When I&#8217;ve finished, 
    I&#8217;ll have beautiful, brown, shiny fingertips and it&#8217;ll take the 
    stuff a couple of days to wear off again. I&#8217;ve never heard of anyone 
    suffering any harmful effects from this, but because of the litigious society 
    in which we are doomed to abide, where going to the toilet or blowing our 
    noses is covered by a sub-section of some Health and Safety legislation, I&#8217;m 
    hereby going on record as telling you that you should be taking appropriate 
    Health and Safety precautions. You&#8217;ll end up with a lousy finish on 
    your sewing machine cover but you&#8217;ll make some over-paid, self-righteous 
    wimp in a pinstriped suit feel very important.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as when we were stripping, 
    we will shellac the cover in definite &#8220;bits&#8221; &#8211; these again 
    being the top, the two sides and the two ends &#8211; five &#8220;bits&#8221;. 
    With newspaper on the table, I did the whole of the top first, to about halfway 
    round the big curve. I then went straight onto one of the sides, tilting the 
    cover so as to be able to get at it more easily but keeping at least one corner 
    resting on the table for stability. Note that the grain is vertical on the 
    sides and ends, so my strokes with the fad were also vertical.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><u>IMPORTANT NOTE</u> &#8211; 
    watch those corners! It&#8217;s very easy to scrape shellac off the fad on 
    corners, thus getting a horrible run on the adjacent side. Work outwards, 
    from the middle towards the edges - not from the outside into the middle. 
    This is exactly the precaution you&#8217;d take if you were painting, but 
    here, your mistakes will have dried and hardened in seconds! Also watch out 
    when you stroke off the edge of the wood with the fad &#8211; it&#8217;s very 
    easy to end up leaving a small deposit at the very end of the stroke. If that 
    happens, stroke it off again IMMEDIATELY, before it sets.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Having finished the side, I turned 
    the cover and continued straight onto the first end &#8211; then the other 
    side and finally the other end &#8211; fading with my right hand and holding 
    the cover at a convenient angle against the table with my left (I&#8217;m 
    right handed). By the time I was doing the last end, and therefore needing 
    to hold the cover by a side that had been faded, the shellac on that side 
    was perfectly dry &#8211; it really does dry fully in a matter of seconds, 
    with no tackiness.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">As soon as the first coat is on, 
    go straight into the second coat &#8211; and then a third &#8211; you don&#8217;t 
    need to give any time between coats. Use a reasonable pressure on the fad 
    in steady, deliberate strokes and as soon as it starts to leave streaks that 
    look a bit too dry, or it starts to drag, dip it in the dish again, remembering 
    to wipe it off well on the dish side and press it against the paper again.<br>
    <br>
    Having got three (or so) coats on, we&#8217;ll let it sit for about 15 minutes, 
    to give the wood an opportunity to draw the shellac into its pores somewhat, 
    if it so wishes. During this time, put the lid back on the dish and wrap your 
    fad tightly in a plastic bag to stop it drying out. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We&#8217;re now going to rub over 
    the surface very lightly indeed with 0000 wire wool, mainly to make sure that 
    there&#8217;s no little bits of anything sticking up from the surface, dust 
    off gently with our tack-cloth and wipe the next couple of coats on in a smallish 
    figure-of-eight motion. Try to imagine each of these eights being very long 
    and thin, much like taking an elastic band, twisting it once to form a figure-of-eight 
    and than stretching it gently, such that the sides of each loop are touching 
    each other, or better still with the shellac, very slightly overlapping each 
    other.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">On each part of the cover, do 
    a series of little figure-of-eights all around the edge first (each figure 
    being probably about an inch or two long), and then do the middle - this is 
    simply to ensure that we don&#8217;t miss any of the edges. Go over the whole 
    cover a couple of times in this way.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Without stopping, give it a couple 
    more coats with the figures-of-eight somewhat longer and then give it four 
    or five coats just using straight strokes again. If at any time you see that 
    you&#8217;ve missed a bit, it&#8217;s usually better to leave it rather than 
    go back &#8211; the next coat will get it.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Always try to use nice long strokes, 
    but in places, that isn&#8217;t practical. On the sides of the Vesta cover 
    there&#8217;s those long horizontal &#8220;humps&#8221; just below the top, 
    and a step a couple of inches from the bottom, and if I&#8217;d tried to go 
    over those in one long stroke, the shellac wouldn&#8217;t have gone on very 
    evenly. One side of the &#8220;hump&#8221; would have scraped a lot of shellac 
    out of the fad whilst the other side wouldn&#8217;t have got much at all, 
    because of the impossibility of applying an equal pressure throughout the 
    stroke. I therefore used a series of different strokes on each side, wiping 
    up-hill from either side of the &#8220;hump&#8221;, and then giving a little 
    wipe over the &#8220;summit&#8221;. I treated the step in a similar way, wiping 
    into it with short strokes from both directions.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The main thing is to LOOK at the 
    results of your work, and if something&#8217;s not going quite right, don&#8217;t 
    keep doing the same thing with each successive coat &#8211; try a slightly 
    different approach.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it&#8217;s time to put the 
    kettle on, guys and gals! Pour the shellac out of the dish back into the bottle 
    and wrap the fadder tightly in its plastic bag &#8211; we&#8217;re not going 
    to do anything else for at least the next 24 hours, to give the shellac a 
    chance to harden. So how many coats have we put on? I&#8217;ve lost count, 
    but it must be around a dozen or so in total &#8211; it really doesn&#8217;t 
    matter either way.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">At this stage, your cover should 
    be looking something like this -</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Shiny.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Linda&#8217;s really going to 
    skin me when she sees I did all this on her SuperQuilter table while she was 
    out teaching! Kinda shiny, ain&#8217;t it? That finish would be very pleasing 
    if we were building a concert piano, but we&#8217;re not &#8211; so 24 hours 
    from now, that gloss is coming off again!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK, guys and gals, having had 
    a 24-hour break, were going to press on. We really are on the home straight 
    now.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The opposite of a gloss surface 
    is a &#8220;flat&#8221; one (a bit of jargon creeping in there). We&#8217;re 
    going to start by &#8220;flatting&#8221; the cover and we do this simply by 
    rubbing the surface all over with 0000 wire wool, until the gloss has gone 
    (just gone, that is &#8211; don&#8217;t rub all the shellac off again!) and 
    it looks like this &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Flatted.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Two things you need to be using 
    here to examine the surface are your eyes and your fingertips. Anyone who 
    spends their time doing very fine, precision work will support me in saying 
    that you can actually see more with your fingers than you can with your eyes. 
    The human finger can easily feel an irregularity of less than one twentieth 
    of a thousandth of an inch, and sure as the Pope&#8217;s a Catholic, you can&#8217;t 
    see that with your eyes!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the flatted finish to 
    make sure that you haven&#8217;t missed any bits &#8211; the &#8220;degree&#8221; 
    of flatting should be even over the whole cover. Now feel the surface with 
    your fingers to see if there are any ridges etc. So why are we bothered about 
    them if the eye can&#8217;t see them? Well, you can&#8217;t see them at the 
    moment, but we&#8217;re now going to put the &#8220;65 year old&#8221; sheen 
    onto the surface, and they will then become visible again because of the uneven 
    reflection of the light that they would cause. I have purposely left the original 
    &#8220;dings&#8221; and &#8220;scrawks&#8221; (fen-speak) in the surface of 
    the wood, partly because to get rid of them would have meant sanding through 
    the patina, but more because they actually add to the authenticity of a 65-year-old 
    item. They will look fine when the finish is completed because they&#8217;ll 
    look like they SHOULD be there, but a run or ridge in the shellac will be 
    an immediate give-away that this piece has been restored, so rub them out 
    now, then wipe the surface gently with your tack-cloth.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Having satisfied yourself that 
    the surface is good, we now apply about three more coats of shellac with our 
    fadder &#8211; straight strokes &#8211; no pause between coats.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We are now going to &#8220;stiff&#8221; 
    the surface (don&#8217;t blame me! I didn&#8217;t dream these terms up!). 
    To do this, we add a little methylated spirits (de-natured alcohol) to some 
    of the polish in our dish &#8211; no more than about one part alcohol to about 
    four parts French polish &#8211; and, using a new fad &#8211; not charged, 
    just dipped and well scraped off on the edge of the dish &#8211; apply one 
    last thin coat, working fairly quickly and trying very hard to avoid runs 
    &#8211; as this mix is a lot more runny than the stuff you&#8217;ve been using 
    so far. This will help us to achieve a very particular sort of sheen at the 
    next stage. Now leave it overnight to harden again.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Next day &#8211; and we&#8217;ve 
    only a few minutes work left to complete the job. Again flat the surface with 
    0000 wire wool &#8211; very gently &#8211; just enough to take the sparkle 
    off evenly again. Now take your good quality wax furniture polish and apply 
    it with 0000 wire wool &#8211; not with a cloth. Give it a really good rubbing 
    with the wax. The 0000 wire wool will keep disintegrating as you do this, 
    so don&#8217;t try to economise, keep getting a fresh bit.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now polish it up with a soft cloth 
    to a nice sheen, let it stand for 20 minutes or so, then wax it again, but 
    this time in the conventional manner &#8211; applying the wax with a cloth. 
    Buff it up again, and it should look like this &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Longview.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Voila! A 65-year-old case in very 
    good condition for its age! Not in mint condition - not looking like a new 
    one - but definitely also not looking like its been reconditioned. This is 
    a &#8220;where did you manage to find one in that condition?&#8221; job, rather 
    than &#8220;you&#8217;ve made a nice job of restoring that&#8221;. Compare 
    this picture with the first picture in this article, and you&#8217;ll see 
    how far we&#8217;ve come. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This has been a long article and 
    perhaps a bit daunting if you&#8217;ve never done this sort of work before, 
    but in reality, each of the stages took no more than a few minutes to do and 
    none of them were terribly difficult. It&#8217;s just a case of taking your 
    time, taking care, thinking about what you&#8217;re doing and most of all 
    &#8211; the golden rule &#8211; paying attention to detail.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Take care and good luck with your 
    restoration.</font></p>
