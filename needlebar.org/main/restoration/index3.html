    FROM THE FENMAN</font></h3>
  <h3 align="center"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">Chapter 4 &#8211;</font><font color="#CC0000" face="Comic Sans MS"> 
    OUR FIRST RESTORATION</font></h3>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, sewing machine guys and gals, 
    and welcome once more to the Needlebar pages on the restoration of sewing 
    machines. Good to see you all again.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this is it &#8211; we&#8217;re 
    about to carry out our first restoration (or desecration, depending on how 
    well things go). In the last article, I talked about the tools, materials 
    and facilities that you will need, and also the skills. Assuming you&#8217;ve 
    got the tools, materials and somewhere to work, we&#8217;ll learn the skills 
    as we go on. Have faith in yourselves, concentrate on what you&#8217;re doing, 
    and you&#8217;ll be OK. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The first project that I&#8217;ll 
    be undertaking is the restoration of a late &#8216;30s Vesta VS111 portable. 
    I picked this machine out of the queue of 50 or more currently in my workshop 
    awaiting a face-lift because its condition is typical for the sort of machines 
    that you good folk will be finding in auctions houses and junk/antique shops. 
    Most of you will have machines in this condition in your collections.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I&#8217;ll warn you now; this 
    article is fairly long. The main part of the restoration is going to be on 
    the woodwork. I could have broken this down into a series of shorter articles, 
    but I felt that once you&#8217;d got started, you wouldn&#8217;t want to have 
    to keep stopping to wait for the next episode, so I&#8217;ve done the wood 
    restoration from start to finish in this one chapter, leaving only the metalwork 
    for the next time. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">JARGON</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
    &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Every occupation tends to have 
    its own language, or &#8220;jargon&#8221;. This is most certainly true of 
    the restoration trade, and the jargon can vary across the UK, so once we start 
    to cross international borders, the problem becomes a nightmare! To further 
    complicate matters, we will be straying into the realms of cabinet making, 
    engineering and antiques, where we will become embroiled in yet more localised 
    jargon. I have been around in all of these fields for a long time and so am 
    fluent in all the various jargons &#8211; for this part of the world.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In these articles, I&#8217;ll 
    use the language that is normal for me. I will, however, try to highlight 
    the terms or expressions that I know, or suspect, are not universally understood, 
    by inserting &#8220;checking for understanding&#8221; paragraphs at relevant 
    points. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">SO WHAT ARE WE 
    UP AGAINST?</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> -</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let&#8217;s have a look at the 
    sort of problems we&#8217;ll to be dealing with -</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Mainview.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it is, straight from the 
    antique shop. Not a pretty sight! That case is showing several of the problems 
    that the restorer has to be able to overcome &#8211; scratches, dirt etc. 
    But hang on! Scratches and dirt aren&#8217;t a big problem! We can get rid 
    of those by cleaning &#8211; we don&#8217;t want to be doing a full-blown 
    restoration for the sake of a bit of dirt and a few scratches.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let&#8217;s take a closer look 
    &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Perished.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah-ha! This looks a bit more serious. 
    The shellac has perished.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><u>CHECKING FOR 
    UNDERSTANDING</u></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> - Do you all know what 
    I mean by &#8220;perished&#8221;? Is this a term that you beautiful people 
    in exotic, far-off, sun-drenched lands beyond the sea use in your everyday 
    parlance? If not &#8211; I&#8217;ll explain.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If (say) a vintage car tyre begins 
    to break up because the rubber is so old that it&#8217;s starting to crumble 
    and disintegrate, then here in the fens, we&#8217;d say that the rubber has 
    &#8220;perished&#8221;. There&#8217;s no way to restore that rubber: once 
    it&#8217;s perished, it&#8217;s scrap. Well, shellac can do the same thing, 
    and once it&#8217;s (significantly) perished, there&#8217;s no way it can 
    be restored, so, like the car tyre, the only option is to remove the old item 
    and replace it with a new product that is as similar to the original as possible. 
    Perishing, by the way, in both rubber and shellac, is significantly accelerated 
    by the ultra-violet content of direct sunlight.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to state at this 
    point that if the original shellac were NOT perished, I would have great difficulty 
    justifying stripping off the original finish from an antique or vintage item. 
    The only other times that I would be likely to strip away an original shellac 
    finish would be if it had been over-varnished with a modern varnish (bring 
    me the head of the antique dealer!) or if the natural colour of the wood has 
    been seriously bleached or faded by long exposure to sunlight, in which case 
    I&#8217;d have to strip away the finish so as to be able to perform some colour-correction 
    (and don&#8217;t you guys go trying THAT one for a long time yet!).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So what other problems are we 
    up against?</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Scratched.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Those scratches look pretty bad. 
    But don&#8217;t be fooled &#8211; scratches will look worse than they actually 
    are and are usually quite easy to deal with without stripping the original 
    finish. If those scratches were the only damage, I wouldn&#8217;t consider 
    stripping the shellac off, but as it&#8217;s perished, I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ve 
    no choice.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The picture shows quite severe 
    scratches on both the cover and the base. However, closer examination of the 
    base reveals very little perishing of the shellac &#8211; certainly not enough 
    to justify stripping it off.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So where are we? We&#8217;ve decided 
    that there&#8217;s no alternative to stripping and replacing the finish on 
    the cover, but that the original finish on the base is salvageable. This scenario, 
    for some reason, is surprisingly common, perhaps because the cover tends to 
    get more exposure to sunlight and the elements than the base.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">But is it worth restoring? Lets 
    have a look what&#8217;s inside.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/NiceVesta.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! What a little beauty! It&#8217;s 
    pretty obvious that the case has fulfilled its purpose of protecting the contents 
    very well indeed. That&#8217;s a very nice, clean example of a late &#8216;30s 
    Vesta VS111, so it&#8217;s well worth putting some effort into making the 
    case look like new again. &#8230;&#8230;. Right? &#8230;&#8230; Wrong!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">That case is over 65 years old 
    and most certainly does NOT want to look like new: it wants to look like a 
    65 year old case in very good condition for its age. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let&#8217;s get one or two things 
    clear before we go any further. We are NOT trying for an immaculate French 
    polished finish &#8211; we&#8217;ll reserve those for concert pianos. It would 
    be totally wrong - not just because the item&#8217;s over 65 years old &#8211; 
    it would be wrong even if the machine were brand new. French polishing is 
    a very lengthy, labour intensive, skilled and expensive operation. These sewing 
    machines were being turned out in millions and the finish that was slapped 
    onto them was meant to LOOK expensive. It failed miserably in the attempt 
    - but it shone.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I sometimes receive commissions 
    to make decorative or ornamental items in wood. I don&#8217;t do it for a 
    living &#8211; but it&#8217;s nice, and very flattering, when someone wants 
    to pay me for my skills, without me having the pressures that come from relying 
    on it to pay the bills. A long time ago, I attended a master class with an 
    elderly gentleman who&#8217;s one of the finest professional ornamental woodworkers 
    in the country. In a matter of minutes, he created a thing of beauty that 
    would have taken us amateurs several hours to make (first sign of a professional 
    &#8211; speed). He asked us all what finish we would use. Being experienced 
    woodworkers, we all agreed that on this particular item, we would use a couple 
    of coats of tung oil, buffed to the very slightest hint of a sheen. He agreed 
    that, had the item been going into his own house, that&#8217;s exactly what 
    he&#8217;d have done &#8211; but then he said &#8220;I do this for a living, 
    therefore I&#8217;m going to slap a pot full of the glossiest gloss varnish 
    I can find onto it &#8211; &#8216;cos the customers never think they&#8217;re 
    getting their money&#8217;s worth unless it shines!&#8221; </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The companies who made sewing 
    machines understood this philosophy &#8211; the more it shone, the more likely 
    it was to sell (hence the Biblical saying &#8220;all that glistens is not 
    gold: it could be a sewing machine&#8221;). But their &#8220;glisten&#8221; 
    most certainly was not gold. On the contrary, it was dirt-cheap! Despite this, 
    had this machine cover been looked after and occasionally polished during 
    its 65 or so year life, it would by now have a warm patina that would be very 
    pleasing to the eye. That&#8217;s the finish we&#8217;re going to replicate.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Get this very clear in your minds 
    - we are not performing a master class in shiny wood finishes, satisfying 
    though that would be. We are &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><u>RESTORING AN ANTIQUE</u> to 
    what it <u>WOULD LOOK LIKE</u> had it been well looked after</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">- not to how it looked when it 
    was new and certainly not to some sort of super-shiny fantasy state that rivals 
    the paintwork on a Rolls Royce!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If your friends, on seeing your 
    work, say, &#8220;that&#8217;s in nice condition&#8221;, then you&#8217;ve 
    succeeded: if they say &#8220;you&#8217;ve made a good job of restoring that&#8221; 
    &#8211; you&#8217;ve failed &#8211; &#8216;cos they shouldn&#8217;t be able 
    to tell that it&#8217;s been restored. Get my drift?</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">RESTORING THE 
    BASE</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The first thing to do is to remove 
    the head from the base. Invariably, the head is retained by two fixings. These 
    clamp onto pegs that stick out from the hinges and allow the head to be tilted 
    back. These are difficult to photograph while the head&#8217;s still in place 
    because on some machines, this one included, the head doesn&#8217;t tilt back 
    very far. I therefore removed the head before taking this picture to show 
    their position.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Position.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">These fixings will normally be 
    either setscrews or grub-screws. I&#8217;m informed by a much loved and respected 
    American member of the Needlebar group that there&#8217;s a definite difference 
    in terms between Britain and America, in that, to the British, a grub-screw 
    is a specific type of setscrew, but our good American cousins don&#8217;t 
    have different names for the different types &#8211; they&#8217;re all simply 
    &#8220;setscrews&#8221; over there.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><u>CHECKING FOR 
    UNDERSTANDING</u></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211; As I will no-doubt 
    forget in future articles that our American buddies don&#8217;t know what 
    a &#8220;grub-screw&#8221; is, and as I am totally ignorant as to what names 
    those of you in other countries use for the basic fixings, let me show you 
    the British standards, then (hopefully) you&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking 
    about in the future.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Screwtypes.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In Britain, the thing on the left 
    of the picture is a &#8220;bolt&#8221;, characterised by the fact that the 
    thread does not go all the way along it and the un-threaded portion is thinner 
    than the threaded portion. The middle object is a &#8220;setscrew&#8221;, 
    the thread going all the way to the head (this is, in fact, one of the setscrews 
    out of the Vesta we&#8217;re working on). Now in Britain, the critter on the 
    right is a &#8220;grub-screw&#8221;, this being a headless setscrew that, 
    if screwed far enough into a deep threaded hole, would disappear completely 
    &#8211; just like a grub. This one, by the way, is from a Singer model 66.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The terms &#8220;bolt&#8221; and 
    &#8220;screw&#8221; have nothing to do with the shape of the head, i.e., one 
    can have a hexagon head and be a &#8220;screw&#8221; or a slotted head and 
    be a &#8220;bolt&#8221;. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, let&#8217;s get the head 
    off. You&#8217;ll need a fairly short, flat bladed screwdriver to just slacken, 
    but not remove, the two setscrews. Now carefully waggle the head off its two 
    mounting pins and put it somewhere safe and out of the way.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now let&#8217;s have a closer 
    look at that base &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Basebefore.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Um - pretty grim. Nasty scratch 
    on the accessory-box lid, very dirty and a little perishing around the edge 
    where the lid doesn&#8217;t quite cover it &#8211; but I&#8217;m not stripping 
    it just for the sake of that bit. Let&#8217;s take a closer look &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Cornerbefore.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">That measuring strip looks pretty 
    grotty! (One of these days, I must tell you how those strips were made). See 
    anything you should be taking note of? You&#8217;ve got it &#8211; those screw 
    heads are aligned &#8211; if you take them out, put them back the same way 
    - more about that later. Now what about the edge &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Edgebefore.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty battered &#8211; but not 
    perished, so I&#8217;d better put my money where my mouth is and prove to 
    you that this can be restored simply by cleaning.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">THE FENMAN&#8217;S 
    ELIXIR OF LIFE</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">At times in these articles, I&#8217;ll 
    describe concoctions that I make up myself to perform particular tasks. Few 
    if any of these are wholly my own invention: most are just my version of brews 
    that have been used by craftsmen since time immemorial. The concoction I use 
    the most is my furniture cleaner: I call it my &#8220;Elixir of Life&#8221; 
    &#8211; guaranteed to cure every ailment known to mankind, from dirt and scratches 
    to beriberi and the black death! It comes in two forms; the &#8220;safe&#8221; 
    version and the &#8220;who dares, wins&#8221; variety. The recipes are a closely 
    guarded secret, known only to those favoured by the gods, and are guarded 
    by pain of death!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">They are as follows &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">ELIXIR OF LIFE 
    &#8211; SAFE VERSION</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"> Equal portions of</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">- white spirits (mineral spirits),<br>
    - vinegar (malt, if possible but pickling vinegar, cider vinegar, white wine 
    vinegar etc. should be OK)<br>
    - linseed oil (preferably raw but boiled will do)</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">ELIXIR OF LIFE 
    &#8211; WHO DARES, WINS VERSION</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">- 2 parts white spirits (mineral 
    spirits)<br>
    - 2 parts vinegar (as above)<br>
    - 2 parts linseed oil (as above)<br>
    - 1 part methylated spirits (de-natured alcohol)</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So what&#8217;s the difference 
    between the two? Well, the &#8220;safe&#8221; version is safe - no more clues. 
    The &#8220;who dares, wins&#8221; version is excellent &#8211; but you have 
    to work fast, as it contains alcohol, which (as you all know by now, if you&#8217;ve 
    been paying attention) dissolves shellac &#8211; so if you work too slowly, 
    it&#8217;ll strip the finish off for you whether you like it or not! However, 
    like a cold toilet seat, its advantages outweigh its disadvantages.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">As removers of dirt and hiders 
    of scratches, there&#8217;s little to choose between the two versions. What 
    the &#8220;who dares&#8221; version does that the &#8220;safe&#8221; version 
    doesn&#8217;t is to slightly dissolve the surface of the shellac, so that 
    any small cracks or early stages of ageing literally melt away. With the &#8220;safe&#8221; 
    version, you can work as slowly as you like, and if any gets splashed onto 
    surfaces where it shouldn&#8217;t be, you simply wipe it off. With the other 
    version, you scrub it on, just as with its better-behaved cousin, but within 
    about half a minute or so, you&#8217;ll need to be wiping it off again, preferably 
    with an absorbent paper kitchen towel. If you splash any onto other shellacked 
    surfaces &#8211; it&#8217;ll make a mark that you&#8217;ll struggle to get 
    rid of. If you press your finger onto the surface while it&#8217;s still wet, 
    you&#8217;ll leave a permanent fingerprint in the shellac. If you splash any 
    onto the metal head of the machine &#8211; it&#8217;ll fetch the finish off 
    that very nicely! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I use the &#8220;who dares&#8221; 
    version all the time. All I&#8217;m saying is &#8211; move the piece you&#8217;re 
    working on well away from the rest of the machine, avoid pressing your finger 
    against the shellac while it&#8217;s still wet and wipe the stuff off again 
    within (about) 30 seconds or so. If you don&#8217;t feel confident that you 
    can do all that, just leave out the alcohol.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Both are applied using our good 
    old friend, 0000 wire wool &#8211; the most useful tool in the restorer&#8217;s 
    toolbox. The ingredients in the elixir will separate out from each other quite 
    rapidly in the (air-tight) bottle, so give it a good shake, remove the top, 
    hold your pad of 0000 against the top of the bottle and tip some onto it. 
    Now scrub the wood for all you&#8217;re worth. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The complete restoration of the 
    base could take as long as ten minutes &#8211; if you&#8217;re a really slow 
    worker!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So what does it look like after 
    it&#8217;s been scrubbed with the elixir and wiped with a kitchen towel?</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Baseafter.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So where&#8217;s that scratch 
    on the accessory box lid gone? Notice that I didn&#8217;t bother to remove 
    the metal furniture &#8211; I just cleaned it with the same stuff. Let&#8217;s 
    take a closer look.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Cornerafter.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">See what I mean about not stripping 
    it? That wood looks pretty darn good to me! But the edge was a real mess &#8211; 
    what does it look like now?</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Edgeafter.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">That&#8217;s exactly the same 
    part of the edge that was in the &#8220;before&#8221; photograph. Not bad, 
    eh? A bit of wax polish is all that&#8217;s needed to complete the restoration
