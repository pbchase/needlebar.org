    FROM THE FENMAN</font></h3>
  <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">Chapter 1 &#8211;</font><font color="#CC0000" face="Comic Sans MS"> 
    INTRODUCTIONS - AND FOOD FOR THOUGHT</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"> Hello, sewing machine people, 
    and welcome to the Needlebar pages on the subject of restoration. I&#8217;m 
    hoping that this will gradually develop into a reference document that will 
    be of assistance to those wishing to improve the condition of the sewing machines 
    in their collections.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">INTRODUCTION -</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When writing articles that are 
    to be perused by others, one immediately leaves oneself open to criticism, 
    or as a boss of mine many years ago said, &#8220;if you make yourself visible, 
    you&#8217;re going to get shot at&#8221;, so the first thing I&#8217;ll need 
    is a nom de plume to hide behind. I&#8217;m a creature of the countryside 
    (and therefore probably subject of a preservation order). A very dear &#8220;townie&#8221; 
    friend from the big city of Manchester always calls me &#8220;Fenman&#8221;, 
    so that&#8217;s who I&#8217;ll be from now on. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I was born in the late &#8216;40s 
    and live with Linda, my dear wife of 35 years, in a somewhat rambling mid-Victorian 
    house in 1&frac12; acres of garden, on the edge of the Lincolnshire fens. 
    Linda is a professional in the field of patchwork and quilting &#8211; primarily 
    as a teacher. My own occupation is far too complex to describe (and not relevant 
    to this subject) so let&#8217;s just say that I have a background and qualifications 
    in several aspects of engineering &#8211; mechanical; electrical; electro-mechanical; 
    electronic and computer &#8211; and have a passion for all aspects of woodworking, 
    with a particular interest in producing reproductions of 18th century English 
    furniture. We have a collection of antique and vintage sewing machines that 
    is growing to the point where the size of our house is becoming an important 
    factor!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">TERMS OF REFERENCE &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst I can claim to have quite 
    a range of knowledge and experience, I&#8217;m not an &#8220;expert&#8221; 
    in anything. These articles should therefore be viewed as humble suggestions 
    and observations, offered by one who&#8217;s done quite a bit of restoration, 
    rather than as any sort of definitive treatise on the subject.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Most techniques that I use are 
    not my own invention: they are the creations of professionals ancient and 
    modern from the worlds of woodworking and antique restoration. When I suggest 
    using a particular method, it will normally mean that I have used it and found 
    it to be a good way to do the job.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#0000FF">EXPERTS - </font></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There are only two types of expert: 
    -</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">EXPERT TYPE 1 &#8211; These are 
    people who &#8220;live&#8221; their subject and really do have a depth of 
    knowledge and a total understanding of their chosen subject that cannot be 
    matched by us mere mortals. Type 1 experts are rare creatures: I could count 
    on my fingers the number that I have known (in all subjects) in my lifetime. 
    One thing that they all seemed to have in common was a modesty and restraint 
    born of the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they had nothing to 
    prove. With all of these people, one could be fooled into thinking that they 
    knew very little about their subject, because they had so little to say. It 
    was only after working with them for a long time that their total mastery 
    became apparent. Experts type 1 are humbling creatures, worthy of the highest 
    respect from us all.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">EXPERT TYPE 2 &#8211; These are 
    the self-appointed &#8220;gurus&#8221; of a subject. Usually (to be fair) 
    reasonably knowledgeable, these creatures have a desperate need to be seen 
    by us &#8220;lesser&#8221; mortals as the fount of all knowledge. This need 
    is born of personal insecurity and usually manifests itself as an inability 
    to be disagreed with &#8211; any challenge to their statements being seen 
    as a personal attack, usually responded to by the challenger being &#8220;struck-off&#8221; 
    and hated and publicly vilified for ever more. Experts type 2 are, and have 
    a need to be, instantly recognisable. They should be pitied rather than despised, 
    for the insecure, humourless, unhappy and desperate souls that they are.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I am definitely not an expert 
    type 1 and hope I will never degenerate into being a type 2. There are no 
    other types.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">RULES OF ENGAGEMENT - </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Any statements or suggestions 
    that I make are there to be questioned or constructively challenged &#8211; 
    this is healthy and might make me think more deeply about the subjects I profess 
    to know a bit about. An approach of &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I agree 
    with what you say&#8221;, from a person who&#8217;s sole objective is to ascertain 
    the true facts, will be welcomed, and should lead to a mutually beneficial 
    discussion and debate. Any type 2 expert who wants to make a show of staging 
    a full-blown confrontation as part of their re-election campaign can clear 
    off and find some like-minded, sad person to hate or dominate.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is not my intention that these 
    pages should be &#8220;The Thoughts of Chairman Fenman&#8221; on the subject 
    of restoration (self-gratifying though that would be), but rather that they 
    should be a compilation of the best knowledge and experience from within the 
    Needlebar group, shared for the benefit of us all. I hope the pattern will 
    be that I will write about a subject and that this will then lead to questions 
    and contributions from other people, thus expanding the subject and making 
    us all more aware of the issues and pitfalls that abound in the field of restoration.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the next article, I will begin 
    the discussion on the definitions and implications of restoration.</font></p>
