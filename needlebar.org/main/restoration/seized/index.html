  Godfrey </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Recently there have been some posts 
  in the NeedleBar Forum regarding seized machines, and so I thought I&#8217;d 
  share with you my method of cleaning or finding where the problem is located. 
  Now let&#8217;s assume our imaginary machine has been taken out of its base 
  or cabinet and we have it sitting on the bench in front of us, with good lighting, 
  so pull up a seat and we&#8217;ll go through the procedure together.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When faced with the difficulty of 
  a seized machine firstly take your time, be patient, don&#8217;t rush at it, 
  jumping from one area to another, our approach must be methodical. In this scenario 
  our machine has an unknown history, we have no idea of its previous use, or 
  how it has been looked after, it&#8217;s just come into our possession. Let&#8217;s 
  study the machine, look it over, its general appearance is going to tell us 
  a great deal about its past and its present condition. How much work it has 
  done, whether it has been used in a long time, is it covered in gunk, what about 
  rust, does anything appear to be bent? Check the hand wheel, does it look straight, 
  does it look to be at 90 degrees to the shaft? A quick glance at the thread 
  take up lever, is it hard up against the casting? Does the presser foot line 
  up? Look for cracks, dents anything to suggest it may have been dropped. The 
  more you look the more you see (Grandad). OK for our scenario it&#8217;s got 
  some rust and it is filthy!!<img src="seized-001.jpg" width="400" height="322" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="right"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Time to start, remove all covers: 
  face plate, needle plate, slide plate, rear cover and top cover, if it has one, 
  and motor belt if electric, don&#8217;t worry about cleaning and oiling just 
  yet. Now remove the hook or shuttle mechanism, with any luck we have just found 
  the problem, I wish, I hear you say!! </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Gently with the hand wheel try and 
  move the machine back and forth, in a rocking action, at the same time watch 
  closely the different mechanisms and shafts for the slightest sign of movement, 
  check every part of the machine for signs. This is a preliminary check and with 
  any luck will locate the problem for us, or at least indicate whether it is 
  at the top or bottom half of the machine. Suppose we spot some faint movement 
  in the needle bar, this indicates that the top shaft, thread take up and needle 
  bar are more than likely free and that the problem is at the bottom of the machine. 
  Should a slight movement be detected on the lower part of the machine the reverse 
  is probably true. Tip: the disengaging knob on the hand wheel will need to be 
  continually tightened during this procedure.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="seized-002.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left">No 
  luck? OK, time to start the cleaning process, a good washout comes first get 
  a tub (a small plastic ice cream container is perfect for this) and a 1 inch/25mm 
  paint brush, cut about &frac12; inch/13mm off the bristles of a new brush to 
  make it good and stiff. I recommend kerosene as the cleaning agent, it works 
  in two ways, it dissolves the dirt and gummed up oil and also acts as a penetrating 
  lubricate. Far cheaper than WD40 to use and it will not harm the paint work 
  if wiped up with a dry rag, you don&#8217;t need to panic here as long as you 
  don&#8217;t leave it on the machine surface for lengthy periods such as overnight. 
  Test the paint or finish in an inconspicuous area if you are not sure or are 
  at all concerned. Pour the kerosene into your tub to approximately 1 inch/25mm 
  deep, dip in your brush and start scrubbing down the mechanics of the machine. 
  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Start at the top shaft right bearing 
  and work your way across to the left bearing, next the needle bar, needle bar 
  frame, presser bar and thread take up mechanism. I usually rock the hand wheel 
  continually as I go, this has two effects, testing for movement and helping 
  to get the kerosene into and between the parts, hopefully speeding up the process 
  of freeing the machine up. The stitch length regulator comes next and finally 
  the lower sections of the machine, starting with the hook drive or the shuttle 
  carrier, working meticulously through the lower shafts and feed mechanism. <img src="seized-003.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="right"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Starting at the top helps speed 
  up the process as the kerosene will run down into the lower sections starting 
  to soften up the gunk. Once the general cleaning is complete you can concentrate 
  on any rust areas that were found during our preliminary inspection, the kerosene 
  will work quickly breaking down the rust and helping to dissolve it. These parts 
  may need additional work later to make them more presentable if badly pitted.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, hopefully by now we will see 
  that the machine is starting to free up and although tight it is starting to 
  turn over. Once any movement is obtained give the whole machine a good liberal 
  dose of clean kerosene and keep working that hand wheel back and forth, at no 
  time force the machine, the hand wheel should give you enough leverage to get 
  things moving. Remember at this point we do not know there is anything else 
  wrong to cause the machine to seize and that this is the first stage of the 
  procedure. Once we have spent some time going through this step of trying to 
  get the machine freed up and we have had no luck, and it is still stuck fast, 
  what next? Pack up, wipe the paint work down with a clean dry rag, clean up 
  your bench and leave the machine to stand, let the kerosene do its work.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="seized-004.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left">Let&#8217;s 
  go and have a cup of tea or coffee, lunch/dinner, take a good long break. Do 
  not continue. The last thing we need is to keep trying and getting ourselves 
  frustrated. That, my friends, is when things start to go horribly wrong. I&#8217;ll 
  say no more.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Feeling refreshed and more importantly 
  with a fresh outlook, time to inspect the machine. Well what do you know, it's 
  working slowly but surely, it's starting to move, yes it's getting better by 
  the minute, keep working it, yes nearly, Wow!! Got it!!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK back to reality it's just not 
  any better. Sorry to get your hopes up, but it&#8217;s time for a second inspection 
  repeating what we did earlier, rocking that hand wheel back and forth and observing, 
  looking for the slightest hint of movement. If it&#8217;s late in the day apply 
  some more kerosene and leave it overnight, these things should not be rushed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the overnight treatment has had 
  no effect, then we do have a problem, now this just makes it more interesting 
  and the challenge more enjoyable. Stay positive. Do not force anything, we still 
  do not know what is really causing our problem and forcing the issue could make 
  matters worst. OK again another inspection, work the hand wheel and pray. Nothing! 
  OK, Stage Two begins.<img src="seized-005.jpg" width="342" height="300" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="right"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Only after the above steps have 
  been taken and all else has failed do we proceed. Now the quickest way to locate 
  the problem area is to isolate the upper and lower mechanisms, we want to narrow 
  down our search. This is achieved by disconnecting the links, rods, shafts or 
  timing belt connecting the two halves of the machine, it is more easily done 
  from the bottom rather than the top of the machine. Straight away you will know 
  whether the problem is in the top or bottom sections, usually one or the other 
  will be as free as a bird, thus eliminating 50% of the machine in one go. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the problem is at the top then 
  the top shaft and bearings would be the first place to look, next the needle 
  bar and thread take up. We are still not sure, but we have to make a start somewhere, 
  loosen off the needle bar, hold it by the needle clamp and rotate or twist the 
  needle bar trying to push it up or pull it down. If it will not move this could 
  well be our problem. OK the needle bar will not move what about the machine, 
  will it move? Let&#8217;s try, the link is still loose and so if the rest of 
  the machine is OK it should move, shouldn&#8217;t it, Bingo!! At last!!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="seized-006.jpg" width="580" height="153" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left">However, 
  if the upper mechanism will still not move we could have more than one problem 
  area. First things first we need to get the upper mechanism free and then we 
  can concentrate on the needle bar. Leave the link loose, time for the rocking 
  motion on the hand wheel again and another application of kerosene. If after 
  some time things are not working out take another break, avoid frustration at 
  all costs. At this stage any problem is likely to be more involved and may require 
  some further dismantling and re-testing as we proceed, we now need to isolate 
  the top shaft. Dismantle the thread take up lever from the crank and then check 
  to see if it is free to move, OK all that is left now is the shaft running through 
  its bearings, as the kerosene has had no effect up to this point it's time for 
  a new approach.<img src="seized-007.jpg" width="373" height="500" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="right"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Moving on to Stage Three, from our 
  initial examination everything seemed to line up correctly no signs of the top 
  shaft having moved. We now have two methods we can employ to get things moving, 
  heat or impact. Heat would always be my first choice, if the machine has seized 
  for no other reason than lack of use, heat should work, note it will not work 
  if something is bent or misaligned. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">How to apply the heat? I use a small 
  hand held Weller gas soldering iron with a heating nozzle fitted where the soldering 
  tip would normally be. This creates a focused heat source about the thickness 
  of a ball point pen. I have read that others here have been successful using 
  a hairdryer and so you can see that extreme heat is not necessary, we certainly 
  don&#8217;t need to see parts glowing red. How does heat help? By expanding 
  the metal and thereby breaking the bond between the two surfaces. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Initially let's heat up the top 
  shaft at both ends near the bearings just enough to feel hot to the touch, not 
  warm, whilst still hot work some kerosene or use WD40 if you prefer into the 
  bearings and start rocking that hand wheel, hopefully it will come free almost 
  immediately. If we are still not successful try again, no good? OK this time 
  place water soaked rags around the shaft at both ends near the bearings, but 
  not touching them and this time apply heat directly to the bearings. We are 
  attempting to expand the bearing whilst keeping the shaft cool, this should 
  allow the kerosene to penetrate into the bearings and also break the bond between 
  the two metals. Ensure the rags are kept wet when applying heat, this stops 
  the shaft from heating up.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><img src="seized-008.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If 
  we decide to use impact we will need a large punch, an old shaft about &frac12; 
  inch/13mm is perfect for this. The best practice here is to use a punch as close 
  as possible to the size of the part being worked on, but no larger. This method 
  should only be used as a last resort, great care should be used when attempting 
  this technique. We need to apply a sharp impact effect to the top shaft, from 
  our present situation the easiest approach would be from the hand wheel end, 
  this will result in less dismantling than from the other end. Remove the hand 
  wheel, place your punch hard up against the end of the top shaft and keeping 
  it in inline with the shaft, this is important as we need to spread the impact 
  over the entire surface area of the end of the shaft. With a hammer inflict 
  a sharp hard blow, do not go the sledge hammer, the bigger the better mentality, 
  a standard workshop hammer is all that you will need.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><img src="seized-009.jpg" width="400" height="270" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="right"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I doubt whether you will need to 
  use this method, but sometimes it combines well with the heat treatment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Should the problem be in the lower 
  half check any gearing and shafts, test the feed carriage in its entirety for 
  binding. Work your way through the lower section of the machine cleaning and 
  testing as you go, much the same as for the top half.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Going about your inspection in this 
  way, you should be able to find and resolve most problems. There are so many 
  scenarios with possible causes, far too many to mention here. A thorough and 
  gentle cleaning as described above will normally free up 95% of machines, even 
  the most stubborn. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="seized-010.jpg" width="400" height="211" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="left">Take 
  your time don&#8217;t rush it, don&#8217;t expect to get the job done in a couple 
  hours, although sometimes you will be amazed at how fast you get a result. Remember 
  it probably took years for the machine to get in this condition. Depending on 
  the situation and the problem you are faced with other methods can be employed, 
  such as drilling. It comes down to problem solving.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">One last thing. When dismantling 
  a machine always lay your parts out neatly with the correct screws, nuts, and 
  washers, this is even more important if you are unfamiliar with the particular 
  machine, you&#8217;ll be surprised at how poor your memory is when it comes 
  time to reassembling.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope this will be of some help or 
  at least give you enough confidence to attempt this type of repair.</font></p>
