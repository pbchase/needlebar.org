  <h3><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">RESTORATION &#8211; THOUGHTS 
    FROM THE FENMAN</font></h3>
  <p><font color="#3300FF" face="Comic Sans MS">Chapter 2 &#8211;</font><font color="#CC0000" face="Comic Sans MS"> 
    DEFINITIONS AND IMPLICATIONS</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, sewing machine people, 
    and welcome once again to the Needlebar restoration pages. In this article, 
    I&#8217;m going to discuss what we actually mean by the term &#8220;restoration&#8221;. 
    I suppose some of you will be wishing I&#8217;d stop waffling and get on with 
    some real work &#8211; but it&#8217;s important that you understand some of 
    the implications before we start getting our hands dirty. Let&#8217;s warm 
    up with a few dictionary definitions &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#3300FF" face="Comic Sans MS">DEFINITIONS -</font></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Preservation &#8211; to keep 
    safe from danger or harm<br>
    - Conservation &#8211; to keep from change, loss or injury<br>
    - Restoration &#8211; the act of restoring to a former or original condition.</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="justify">
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"> (Collins Concise Dictionary &#8211; second edition, 
    1988. 1.6 million words of text for nine pounds and ninety five pence &#8211; 
    those were the days!)</font></p>
</div>
<div align="center"> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The definitions of &#8220;preservation&#8221; 
    and &#8220;conservation&#8221; are so similar that we can, for the sake of 
    this article, just use &#8220;conservation&#8221;.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So, which are we going setting 
    out to do &#8211; conservation or restoration? Well, whilst the main focus 
    of these pages is going to be on restoration, it will be very worthwhile to 
    discuss conservation first.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">CONSERVATION &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a passion for 18th century 
    furniture. If an item were to come into my possession that was fairly late, 
    not terribly rare and not of particularly great monetary value, I consider 
    that I have enough skill, knowledge and experience to be able to perform a 
    perfectly satisfactory restoration. If (please God!) I suspected that an item 
    was by a certain Mr Thomas Chippendale; I would not be so arrogant as to even 
    begin to think of restoring it myself. I would also most likely not be able 
    to afford to have it restored by one of the specialist restorers. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">That would leave me with two options 
    &#8211; either sell it to someone who could afford to restore it, or if (selfishly) 
    I couldn&#8217;t bear to part with it, make sure that its condition does not 
    deteriorate any further &#8211; i.e., conserve it, so that it could be restored 
    professionally at a later date. Some parts of our sewing machines are prime 
    targets for restoration &#8211; particularly the woodwork. Other parts cannot 
    (realistically) be restored &#8211; for example, the decals &#8211; but we 
    don&#8217;t want them to deteriorate - so part of our restoration programme 
    will involve conservation. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">RESTORATION &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When you begin to contemplate 
    improving the condition of an old sewing machine, you are - like it or not 
    - entering the world of &#8220;antique restoration&#8221; &#8211; a strange, 
    mystical and shadowy place inhabited by all sorts of secret practitioners 
    and black magicians (or so they would have you believe!).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There are lots of different creatures 
    lurking in the amateur regions of this world. Amongst the most prominent are 
    &#8211; </font></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="justify"> 
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">- <font color="#0000FF">The Guru</font> &#8211; 
      actually does very little. Usually says that &#8220;amateurs shouldn&#8217;t 
      be attempting restoration&#8221;, to hide the fact that he doesn&#8217;t 
      really possess either the knowledge or the skills required. This person 
      is also often an Expert type 2 (see chapter 1). Not dangerous &#8211; just 
      annoying.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="justify"> 
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">- <font color="#0000FF">The Amateur Expert</font> 
      &#8211; usually knows quite a bit and is often pretty good &#8211; but may 
      not be quite as good as he or she likes to think. Can be dangerous to rare 
      and high-value items.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">- <font color="#0000FF">The Clueless</font> 
      &#8211; for some reason, these always seem to be really likable people. 
      Sometimes having the sense to ask for advice &#8211; but often not - they 
      blunder onwards, the possible historic value of an item only seeming to 
      occur to them after they&#8217;ve destroyed it. Potentially quite dangerous.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">- <font color="#0000FF">The 
    Enthusiastic Novice</font> &#8211; the most common type of amateur &#8211; 
    and by far the most dangerous. Also sometimes referred to as &#8220;The Terminator&#8221;, 
    as most antiques will be rendered worthless within minutes by this creature. 
    Enthusiastic Novices can be created en-masse simply by writing articles such 
    as this about restoration and publishing them on a web site!</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="center">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">An antique or vintage sewing machine 
    is an item that is old and has two histories. Firstly, it is a part of our 
    social history. It has influenced the progress of mankind in many areas of 
    industry, and significantly altered the life of the ordinary housewife. Possibly 
    only the gun and the clock have had a more profound effect in changing the 
    lives of so many people over the last 150 years. But each individual sewing 
    machine also has a history of its own. Who were the people who made it - who 
    bought it when it was new &#8211; were they really proud to own it - where 
    did they live &#8211; were they rich or poor &#8211; was it passed down through 
    their family &#8211; what happy times or tragedies has it been a witness to? 
    In most cases, we&#8217;ll never know, but we should respect the fact that 
    it has survived wars, pestilence and goodness knows what else - and hope that 
    it survives us! We need to have respect for the skilled crafts people who 
    gave it life and for the owners who have cherished it during its years of 
    hard work. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst technically, we &#8220;own&#8221; 
    the sewing machines in our collections, I prefer to think of us as &#8220;custodians&#8221;, 
    looking after the machines for a period of time before they are passed on 
    to future generations. We&#8217;re only passing through this world before 
    going on to a better or worse place (your beliefs &#8211; your choice etc.). 
    Those machines were working hard long before we were born. It&#8217;s our 
    duty to try to make sure that their existence is a little less transient than 
    ours.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">APPROACHES TO 
    RESTORATION &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Your approach to restoration will 
    almost certainly be influenced by whereabouts on the planet you happen to 
    be standing. The two main styles that I&#8217;ll talk about here are those 
    accepted in America and the U.K. These tend towards being the two extremes; 
    thus the restoration styles found in most other countries usually fall somewhere 
    between the two.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our American cousins tend to like 
    their antiques to be as near perfect as possible &#8211; &#8220;as new&#8221; 
    sells well over there &#8211; they like &#8216;em to shine! Although I&#8217;m 
    English, I have a great deal of sympathy with the American philosophy. Most 
    antiques were made by highly skilled craftsmen or women. Those people took 
    great pride in their work and went to considerable lengths to make their products 
    beautiful as well as functional. When the products were new, they looked new 
    &#8211; and that&#8217;s the way the makers intended them to look. If an antique 
    ends up in a rickety and dilapidated state, it no longer looks the way its 
    maker intended it to look, nor does it fulfil the function for which it was 
    created. It can be argued that we show the greatest respect for those long-dead 
    craftsmen and women if we restore the item to its original condition and make 
    it capable of again doing the job that it was built for. If we simply conserve 
    the item in its dilapidated state, it could be considered that, although we 
    are arresting its decline, we are showing little respect for its original 
    creator, who most certainly wouldn&#8217;t want his or her name associated 
    with it in that state!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">American restorers will go to 
    great lengths to make antiques look as good as new &#8211; which I can applaud. 
    To achieve this, many of them will use the best materials available today 
    &#8211; epoxy adhesives, synthetic varnishes etc.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where the British restorers 
    fall-out with their American counterparts. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The British approach is much more 
    minimalist - the art of doing nothing &#8230;&#8230; but making a very good 
    job of it! The British taste is for an antique to be in very good condition 
    &#8211; for its age. If it&#8217;s 150 years old, they like it to look 150 
    years old and show the signs of having been used throughout its long existence 
    &#8211; but still to be in &#8220;nice&#8221; condition. The fundamental rule 
    of British restoration is that any work done should be reversible, so that 
    developments in the field of restoration can be applied in the years to come. 
    Also, British restorers usually use materials that are as near as possible 
    identical to those used originally. Work carried out using such products as 
    epoxy adhesive is most certainly not reversible. In addition, we don&#8217;t 
    know what the long-term effects will be on the original wood and metal. It&#8217;s 
    simply not known if these modern materials will degrade the original wood 
    etc. more quickly than would otherwise have happened. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So these are the two extremes 
    of thought. Neither is right &#8211; neither is wrong, so take your pick. 
    I, being English, will be mainly using the British approach in these articles, 
    but this will make little difference to those of you from other, far-flung 
    lands across the sea, because although the glues, varnishes etc. may be different, 
    the processes used are substantially the same.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope that the above thoughts 
    will help you to develop the sense of responsibility that will be needed if 
    you are to not end-up joining the ranks of the &#8220;Enthusiastic Novices&#8221;, 
    destroying all before you!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"> <font face="Comic Sans MS">&#8220;Yes &#8211; very nice 
    &#8211; but when are we going to make a start?&#8221; I hear you say, straining 
    at the leash! Well, there&#8217;s just one more area that we need to explore 
    before taking the plunge, this being the tools and materials that we will 
    be using for our restoration work. In the next article, we will be discussing 
    these, along with examining the ways in which wood behaves (or misbehaves) 
    under various conditions. We will also look at the skills that we will need 
    to develop in order to produce work that we can be proud of.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">See you all again soon.</font></p>
