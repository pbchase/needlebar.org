  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">PREPARING THE 
    CASE FOR RESTORATION</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The first job is to remove the 
    furniture &#8211; that&#8217;s all the bits of metal etc. &#8211; but before 
    you do, take a good look at them &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Screws.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">See how the slots in those screw 
    heads all point in the same direction? We&#8217;ve seen this before &#8211; 
    remember the base? This feature was used by craftsmen on the better quality 
    18th and 19th century furniture, the screw heads on hinges, locks etc. would 
    always be aligned in this way &#8211; it was part of the &#8220;attention 
    to detail&#8221; that made the piece of furniture a &#8220;quality&#8221; 
    item. The practice largely died out in this country in the second half of 
    the 19th century, but you will find it on German sewing machines at least 
    until the 1940s.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">As I said in the last article, 
    the secret of success in all things is attention to detail, so if you want 
    to be a good restorer, take note of the little details &#8211; and put things 
    back the way they were. Another small point &#8211; I always like to put each 
    screw back into the same hole it came out of. It&#8217;s not unusual, particularly 
    on older items, to find that screws that should all be the same size are not 
    quite identical to each other.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now let&#8217;s have a good look 
    at all the joints. Oh! What have we here?</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Gap.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">It&#8217;s coming apart at the 
    seams! Well, perhaps that&#8217;s a slight exaggeration - but one corner&#8217;s 
    coming apart, so we&#8217;ll have to fix that.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst we&#8217;re looking at 
    the picture, this is a good opportunity to explain something about veneer. 
    Can you see that there&#8217;s some veneer coming away on the inside of the 
    case? &#8220;So why did they bother to veneer it on the inside?&#8221; I hear 
    you all ask. Well, when we glue a piece of veneer to one side of a piece of 
    wood, the veneer is wet from the glue and has therefore expanded across its 
    grain (remember the bit about wood expansion and contraction in the last article?). 
    When it dries, it shrinks again, and this contraction will exert quite enough 
    force to cause even a fairly thick piece of timber to bow over time. To prevent 
    this from happening, it is normal to veneer both sides of the wood at the 
    same time, thus causing the shrinkage forces to work in opposition to each 
    other. Needless to say, whilst the veneer on the outside is cut from some 
    attractive wood, the inside veneer can be any old rubbish &#8211; as long 
    as it has similar expansion and contraction characteristics to the outer veneer. 
    Take a look under one of your veneered treadle tables &#8211; you&#8217;ll 
    find that it&#8217;s also veneered on the underside for this very reason.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Before we can re-glue the corner, 
    we&#8217;ll have to clean out the joint as best we can. We especially need 
    to scrape away as much of the old glue as possible. Wood glue works by being 
    very slightly absorbed into the fibres of the wood. If the old glue is still 
    there, it&#8217;ll act as a barrier that will prevent this absorption from 
    taking place, thus our new glue will merely be stuck to the old glue and not 
    the wood &#8211; and the old glue&#8217;s already failed once &#8211; so is 
    quite likely to do so again. However, if, in conjunction with cleaning the 
    joint well, we use glue that is identical to the original, we will achieve 
    a good bond. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wedge the joint open with (say) 
    a screwdriver blade and scrape out as much as you can with whatever you can 
    get into the gap &#8211; a knife blade; a broken hacksaw blade etc. Don&#8217;t 
    forget to clean under that veneer &#8211; we&#8217;ll be gluing it back down 
    as well. You&#8217;ll not be able to get at all of it, but spend a few minutes 
    cleaning it as best you can.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Before I apply glue to a joint, 
    I always do a &#8220;dummy run&#8221;. This is to make sure that whatever 
    clamps etc. that I&#8217;m going to use will fit OK.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Glueing.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I have all sorts of fancy clamps 
    in my workshop &#8211; scores of the little darlings &#8211; but I&#8217;m 
    using them all the time and they&#8217;re very convenient. If I didn&#8217;t 
    do very much woodwork, I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be spending my hard-earned 
    money on clamps &#8211; there&#8217;s always another way to hold two bits 
    of wood together while the glue sets &#8211; string; weights; bulldog clips; 
    elastic bands etc., etc., etc., - be inventive! You don&#8217;t need a lot 
    of pressure &#8211; most people who use clamps tighten them far too tight 
    and end up squeezing the glue out of the joint again. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Just to talk you through the arrangement 
    shown above: the large clamp with the yellow ends is holding the main joint 
    closed; the smaller clamp is holding the veneer in place. Notice that I have 
    put wooden blocks under the jaws of the small clamp: this is to prevent its 
    metal jaws from marking the wood. Notice also that I have put a small piece 
    of plastic sheet between the wood blocks and the cover: this is to prevent 
    the blocks from becoming a permanent feature of the cover if some of the glue 
    squeezes out!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The glue we&#8217;ll be using 
    is pearl/hide/animal glue &#8211; whatever they call it in your part of the 
    world. Why? Well because that&#8217;s what was used originally and because 
    it&#8217;s a reversible process (one of the first rules of restoration). Please, 
    please don&#8217;t go using PVA or any of the other, non-reversible, modern 
    synthetic glues. Ethics apart, the remnants of the original glue in the fibres 
    of the wood will prevent them adhering as well as they should, whilst new 
    pearl glue will bond to the original hide glue. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what pearl glue looks 
    like when you buy it &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Pearls.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hundreds of little pearls. This 
    is one of the oldest glues known &#8211; it&#8217;s been in use for hundreds 
    of years and is still unsurpassed for many tasks, in particular veneering, 
    where there&#8217;s no realistic alternative if you&#8217;re going to do a 
    good job. It is not, however, as convenient to use as modern glues, as it 
    requires some preparation and it has to be applied hot.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Like all worthwhile crafts, antique 
    restoration incorporates a great many skills and techniques that have to be 
    learned and practiced. This is what makes the difference between a skilled 
    restorer and someone with a pot of PVA and a tin of varnish. The restorer&#8217;s 
    motivation is a total respect for the item they&#8217;re working on rather 
    than a need to impress the masses with how quickly they can work and how much 
    they can make something shine. Always place ethics before ego. Let they that 
    worship at the altar of PVA and varnish seek sustenance elsewhere &#8211; 
    there&#8217;s nothing for them here.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Although we are now starting to 
    use traditional materials, which require a bit of work on our part, don&#8217;t 
    be frightened of them. We&#8217;re so used to the light coming on when we 
    flick a switch and toothpaste coming out of a tube when we squeeze it that 
    we expect everything to be served up on a plate for our ultimate convenience. 
    We even have little buttons that we can press so that we don&#8217;t have 
    to lift our fat, semi-comatose posteriors out of our armchairs to change channels 
    on the TV! Most of these slob-building luxuries are products of recent years: 
    our grandparents didn&#8217;t have them. Does that mean that our grandparents 
    were so much more clever than us, thus enabling them to use more complicated 
    products? I think not! It was just normal for them to have to use a bit of 
    effort and they would fall about laughing at us grinding to a halt as soon 
    as we can&#8217;t get everything out of a tube! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pearl glue is quite easy to use 
    &#8211; it just doesn&#8217;t come out of a tube! Most of the traditional 
    products that we&#8217;ll be using require minimal skills that can be mastered 
    very quickly and easily &#8211; but we can&#8217;t just open a tin and slap 
    them on! Be patient, take the time to learn, and you&#8217;ll do a good job.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some pearl glue sold today is 
    still made in the traditional way &#8211; from boiling animal hides &#8211; 
    whilst some is supposedly produced synthetically, to stop the cat lovers from 
    going into a decline. I have used both and can detect no difference whatsoever 
    between them: they even smell the same - absolutely terrible - so I wouldn&#8217;t 
    worry which you&#8217;re getting. The only version to avoid is the one sold 
    under a very well known trade name that claims to be &#8220;cold hide glue&#8221;, 
    and &#8211; yes, you&#8217;ve guessed it &#8211; comes out of a tube!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The pearl glue you buy will have 
    instructions - follow them. In most cases, it&#8217;ll be something to the 
    effect of covering the pearls with cold water overnight, then throwing that 
    water away, covering the pearls with fresh water and heating in a glue kettle. 
    Now a glue kettle&#8217;s an expensive bit of kit and you really don&#8217;t 
    need one unless you&#8217;re using pearl glue all the time. I don&#8217;t 
    own one (too mean with my money!). All they are is a means of heating the 
    glue indirectly, using hot water. Below is a picture of how I do it.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Kettle.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Put the pearls with just a covering 
    of water into a clean jar, stand it in a saucepan of water, and heat it (don&#8217;t 
    boil it). If you have a camping stove or something similar, which would allow 
    you to do this outside of the house, this would be a definite advantage, as 
    the stuff has a smell reminiscent of a dead rat lying on the heating pipes 
    under the floorboards!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">As the pearls dissolve into the 
    water, we will heat it to the point where, if you dip a small brush into the 
    glue and lift it out again, the glue runs off in a thin, smooth, creamy flow 
    &#8211; not in blobs and not like water. You may need to adjust the temperature 
    or add either a few more pearls or a little more water to achieve this. Once 
    it&#8217;s ready, remove the saucepan from the heat and take it to where you&#8217;re 
    working. Use a small brush to apply the glue to the required surfaces &#8211; 
    try to work fairly quickly &#8211; wipe away any excess with a damp cloth 
    and clamp/weight/tie it all up. Working in a warm place will help the glue 
    to not cool too quickly until you&#8217;re finished. You can buy special glue 
    brushes, but it&#8217;s not worth it for this small a job &#8211; any small 
    brush or even a small, flat stick will do to get the glue into the joint. 
    Leave it for a few hours (overnight is ideal) and remove the clamps. There 
    &#8211; that wasn&#8217;t too bad, was it? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">STRIPPING THE 
    OLD FINISH</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go then, guys and gals, 
    time to get your hands dirty: if you get your hair and your boots dirty as 
    well, you&#8217;re working too quickly. You may have noticed that the photograph 
    of the head of the machine was taken on a table set up outside my workshop 
    door (grass in the background etc.). My intention was to prove that this is 
    actually a viable &#8220;kitchen table&#8221; job and does not need to be 
    done in a fancy workshop. I called &#8220;match abandoned&#8221; after about 
    two minutes &#8211; it was early March in the fens and it was too darn cold! 
    I retired to my (heated) workshop &#8211; but I could have done it outside 
    if I wasn&#8217;t such a wimp!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">One very important thing to say 
    to you at this point &#8211; don&#8217;t ever try to remove the old finish 
    by sanding it off! That veneer is very thin &#8211; typically about one millimetre 
    &#8211; and the old finish won&#8217;t have a consistent hardness or thickness 
    over the whole of its surface, so if you try to sand it off, you&#8217;ll 
    be through the veneer in some places before you&#8217;re through the varnish 
    in others! Result &#8211; one scrap sewing machine cover! You&#8217;ve been 
    warned! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">So let&#8217;s start removing 
    the original finish. I&#8217;m going to use a good quality paint and varnish 
    stripper. I&#8217;m not going to use one of those green, eco-friendly, new-age, 
    water-based ones that are safe to feed to babies and hamsters, &#8216;cos 
    they&#8217;re rubbish. Read the instructions on the tin: if it tells you to 
    neutralise it with water, put it right back on the shelf. What you&#8217;re 
    looking for is one where the instructions either tell you to neutralise it 
    with methylated spirits (de-natured alcohol), or that it&#8217;s self-neutralising 
    (in which case, we&#8217;ll still use alcohol, &#8216;cos I never trust that 
    &#8220;self-neutralising&#8221; bit!). </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We&#8217;re going to strip the 
    case a bit at a time &#8211; the bits being the top, the two sides and the 
    two ends &#8211; i.e., five bits. Varnish stripper can do a lot of damage 
    if it gets onto things that you didn&#8217;t want it to &#8211; and that includes 
    your skin - so let&#8217;s have plenty of old newspapers, old clothes, rubber 
    gloves and eye shields. If you see a picture of me doing this work without 
    wearing the necessary protection &#8211; don&#8217;t do as I do - do as I 
    say. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Stippling.jpg" width="525" height="700"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">STEP ONE &#8211; 
    BRUSHING THE STRIPPER</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> - </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many of you will have used chemical 
    stripper on paint. It works much, much more quickly on shellac, so the minutes 
    of waiting-time associated with paint become seconds when you&#8217;re stripping 
    shellac.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the way that I apply the 
    stripper. I chose a fairly small area (in this case, just the top) and paint 
    it, fairly thickly, over the whole area. Don&#8217;t try to economise with 
    stripper &#8211; slap it on pretty thickly &#8211; but not so thickly that 
    it starts to run down the sides. I then work across the same area, stabbing 
    with the brush in a stippling action.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the picture above, I&#8217;ve 
    painted the whole of the top and have stippled the front half. Can you see 
    how the stippling is lifting the shellac away from the wood? That gunge on 
    the surface is the dissolved shellac coming away.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><u>CHECKING FOR 
    UNDERSTANDING</u></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211; Gunge - an alternative 
    expression to the one I&#8217;d actually use, were I not in polite company. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">STEP TWO &#8211; 
    SCRAPING</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> -</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/Scraping.jpg" width="525" height="700"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">OK &#8211; so how come I&#8217;m 
    suddenly working on the side of the cover instead of the top? Well don&#8217;t 
    go worrying your pretty little heads about the minor details &#8211; just 
    look at what I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;m pulling that scraper towards me (I&#8217;m 
    standing to the left of the picture; no more clues) &#8211; dragging it rather 
    than pushing it &#8211; just the opposite of the action you&#8217;d use if 
    you were stripping paint. Note also that I&#8217;m scraping, as much as possible, 
    in the direction in which the wood grain is running. The sole objective of 
    this stage of the process is to remove as much of that gunge as possible, 
    so after each stroke, wipe the edge of your scraper clean with a piece of 
    newspaper.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">You may also be wondering why 
    my scraper doesn&#8217;t have a handle. The answer is simple &#8211; I&#8217;m 
    far too tight-fisted with my cash to buy them, so, having a metal-cutting 
    guillotine in my workshop, I scrounge old disposable-type wood saws that other 
    folks are throwing out and cut up the blades on the guillotine to make scrapers. 
    Cheap, or what!</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">STEP THREE &#8211; 
    WIRE WOOL</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Once the scraping has removed 
    all the shellac, I take some fairly course wire wool, pour some stripper onto 
    it and scrub the surface (not too hard). This is mainly to remove the last 
    remaining traces of gunge and should be done pretty quickly after step two, 
    as the gunge has an annoying habit of setting again. If any of it does set, 
    simply apply more stripper to it using your wire wool and scrub it off straight 
    away. Don&#8217;t try to economise on wire wool &#8211; when it starts to 
    clag up (good old fenland expression there) throw it away and get a fresh 
    piece.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Once ALL the gunge has been removed, 
    it should look something like this -</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/2ndresult.jpg" width="525" height="700"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This shows you what it should 
    look like after you&#8217;ve wire wooled off the last of the gunge. Just compare 
    the top with the side, which hasn&#8217;t been worked on yet. Starting to 
    look pretty darn good, eh?</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">You&#8217;re going to repeat steps 
    one to three on the remaining &#8220;bits&#8221; - the two sides and the two 
    ends &#8211; complete each &#8220;bit&#8221; before starting the next.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Comic Sans MS">STEP FOUR &#8211; 
    NEUTRALISING THE STRIPPER</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"> &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">All this involves is using our 
    fairly course wire wool again, but this time dipped in methylated spirits 
    (de-natured alcohol) and, once again, working in the direction of the grain. 
    This should remove every last visible trace of the shellac and stripper gunge. 
    As soon as the whole thing looks really clean, give it a really good scrub 
    over with some methylated spirits (de-natured alcohol) on a cloth, to get 
    rid of the invisible traces and neutralise the last of the stripper. You should 
    now have something like this &#8211;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="pics/3rdresult.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we&#8217;re getting somewhere! 
    This is where all the hard work starts to feel worthwhile. Let the job dry-off 
    for a few minutes, then on to step five.</font></p>
