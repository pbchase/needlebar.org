<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">QUILTING</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><img src="quilt.jpg" width="316" height="271"></p>
<p align="justify">Make a crease across the material, and sew a straight line 
  upon it. Then adjust the gauge to the required width for the next line of sewing, 
  and guide the fabric with the line already sewn directly under the gauge arm.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">THE DOUBLE HEMMER</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><img src="2xhemmer.jpg" width="431" height="291"></p>
<p align="justify">The hemmer must be secured by means of the thumb screw as shown 
  in the illustration with the coil through which the material passes fixed immediately 
  in front of the presser foot, regulate the distance of the sewing from the edge 
  of the hem, by sliding the hemmer further away from or closer to the line of 
  the needle. Take hold of the edge to be hemmed and draw it tightly into the 
  hemmer from the side, and by drawing it backwards and forwards a few times work 
  into the folds of the hemmer, drop the presser foot, and commence to sew, first 
  assuring yourself that the hem is properly folded. As the fabric enters the 
  hemmer, guide it with the right hand, holding the edge slightly turned over 
  in the direction of the hem. Broad hems may be made by turning them down by 
  hand and using the plain guide.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">HEMMER - How to make a Narrow Hem</font></b></h3>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Adjust the hemmer to the presser bar; commence 
  the hem by folding it at the end, then pass a thread through it by means of 
  a needle, drawing the thread and the fabric into the hemmer (or pass the edge 
  of the fabric into the hemmer without a thread), lower the lifter and commence 
  sewing, guiding the edge of the fabric with the right hand. <i>If the edge unfolds 
  out of the hemmer, move the fabric to the </i><b>RIGHT</b>, <i>if it folds too 
  much into the hemmer, move the fabric to the </i><b><font size="4">LEFT.</font></b></font></p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">TUCKER</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><img src="tucker.jpg" width="382" height="267"></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">The tucker is attached to the machine by means 
  of the right hand thumb screw, which also answers for securing in its place 
  the adjustable gauge, while the one at the left is used to hold the under marking 
  lever in its place. After having been adjusted to the proper position to produce 
  the required width of tuck, the loop which attaches to the needle-bar, by means 
  of the needle-clamp nut, and through which the upper marking-lever passes, should 
  be so adjusted that the notch in the lever shall only press heavily enough upon 
  the goods to produce a distinct crease; any required width of tuck may be produced 
  by properly adjusting the gauge and marking lever.</font></p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">TRIMMER</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><img src="trimmer.jpg" width="296" height="229"></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Adjust the trimmer to the presser bar; place 
  the braid, velvet, or ribbon in the slot, and under the needle; then guide the 
  fabric and trimming to stitch on the desired line or pattern.</font></p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">ADJUSTABLE BINDER</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><img src="binder.jpg" width="311" height="246"></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Adjust the binder to the desired width of binding, 
  fix it firmly to the machine with the thumb screw; place the end of the binding 
  over the feed points, and its edges under the clips; then place the fabric between 
  the clips, and guide it against the binder. If the sewing is not on the edge 
  of the binding, loosen the screw, and move the binder a little to the right 
  or left until it is in the right position; the under-clip may be adjusted to 
  fold the binding wider on the under than the upper side of the fabric.</font></p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">CORDER</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><img src="corder.jpg" width="365" height="290"></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Adjust the corder-foot to the presser bar, pass 
  the cord into the eye of the guide, which is held in the left hand between the 
  folds of the fabric, with its end opposite the first groove in the foot; in 
  placing each succeeding cord, guide the fabric with the last cord sewn in the 
  second groove of the foot. <i>In cording, always turn a square corner while 
  the needle rests in the fabric.</i></font></p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">BRAIDING</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><img src="braid.jpg" width="426" height="516"></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Adjust the braider to the presser-bar, pass 
  the braid through the eye at the top of the arm, then take a short piece of 
  thread and pass the ends through the slot in the braider, forming a loop; place 
  the end of the braid into the loop, and drawing the thread through the slot, 
  the braid will pass through with it (Or pass the braid through by pushing the 
  end with the point of a needle.) Stamp or trace the design on the fabric, and 
  guide it as required.</font></p>
