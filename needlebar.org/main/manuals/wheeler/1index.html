<p align="justify"><strong><font color="#000000">To Hem.</font></strong> Take 
  out the Glass-foot (with the needle wrench) and substitute the hemmer. Fold 
  the hem for about half an inch, and insert it in the hemmer far enough for the 
  needle to catch the hem. The edge of the cloth should pass completely around 
  the scroll as in the above cut. If the hemmer does not turn the edge of the 
  goods completely under, but leaves a raw edge, turn the edge in the left hand 
  a little towrds you. If too much is turned in, turn it from you. To hem bias 
  worsted goods, hold them stretched.</p>
<p align="justify">If the needle is bent, so that it does not catch the edge of 
  the hem, spirng it <em>from </em>you. If it strikes too far from the edge and 
  into the center of the hem, spring it <em>to </em>you.</p>
<p align="justify">To make a wide hem, fold the cloth (once only) the width of 
  the required hem. Pass the edge into the hemmer, as in making a narrow hem, 
  the extra width extending back from the hemmer.</p>
<p align="justify">To fell, sew up the two edges, the lower extending about an 
  eighth of an inch beyond the upper. A good rule is to have the hemmer in the 
  cloth-presser, and have the edge of the lower piece of cloth pass exactly under 
  the farther edge of the hemmer, and the edge of the upper piece pass under the 
  opening in the hemmer.</p>
<p align="justify">Nearly the whole secret of felling is in sewing this seam.</p>
<p align="justify">Then open the goods well, and fell down the projecting edges 
  with the hemmer, as in the cut below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="06.jpg" width="486" height="178"></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font color="#000000"><img src="07.jpg" width="247" height="211" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="right">The 
  Large Gauge</font></strong> is used for wide tucking, quilting, and plaiting 
  shirt bosoms. It is fastened by the Thumbscrew to the under side of the Stationary 
  Arm, as in the cut, and can be moved forward or backward, according to the width 
  of tuck or plait required.</p>
<p align="justify">To adjust the Gauge for quilting loosen the screw which connects 
  the parts, and raise the lower part to allow the goods to pass between it and 
  the Cloth-plate; then tighten the screw.</p>
<p align="justify">The last seam sewed should pass directly under the gauge, and 
  the next seam will be parallel with it.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font color="#000000">The Plate Gauge</font></strong>, 
  for sewing close to an edge, or for tucking, is screwed to the Cloth-plate, 
  using the Thumbscrew. For sewing a very narrow seam or tuck, use the glass with 
  the under side cut away.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font color="#000000"><img src="08.jpg" width="326" height="272" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left"></font></strong></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font color="#000000">The Braider</font></strong> is 
  of glass, with two holes in it, one for the braid, the other for the needle, 
  and fits in the cloth presser. To braid, pass the braid through the left hole 
  of the braider, and draw the end out under the cloth presser to the right, being 
  careful to have it pass under the needle.</p>
<p align="justify">After the first stitch is taken the braid will be drawn through 
  with the goods by the feed point.</p>
<p align="justify">The Glass Corder is a glass foot with grooves on the under 
  side. Insert the cord between the folds of the goods, and crease it close to 
  the edge with the needle-wrench or scissors. Place the goods under the Cloth 
  presser, with the cord in teh groove nearest the operator, and stitch as usual. 
</p>
<p align="justify">If the cord is held straight it is more easily placed close 
  to the edge.</p>
