<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#000000">IMPORTANT - DO NOT RUN MACHINE BACKWARDS</font></b></p>
<p align="left">Remember that every machine before leaving the factory is thoroughly 
  tested on all kinds of work and that it MUST BE RIGHT WHEN RECEIVED. Should 
  there be anything about the machine which you do not understand, correspond 
  or communicate with the manufacturer or your dealer before condemning it.<img src="01.gif" width="283" height="493" align="right" hspace="10"></p>
<p align="left">Do not allow anyone to tinker with your machine under any circumstances. 
  You will no doubt have numerous sewing machine repairers that will want to clean, 
  adjust and fix it up, or there will be agents for other machines that may call 
  and want to operate it. Never allow them to get their hands on the machine, 
  for many cases have been known where dishonest agents would bend or disarrange 
  something about the machine so that it would not work properly, then contend 
  that it was no good and want to sell one of the style they handle. </p>
<p align="left">Always bear in mind that this machine is WARRANTED, and that if 
  anything about it is wrong it will be made right. Always speak a good word for 
  your machine WHENEVER and WHEREVER you can.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO THREAD THE MACHINE (Upper Thread)</font></h3>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000">Place spool on spool pin <font color="#CC3333">A</font>, 
  lead the thread from the spool under pin <font color="#CC3333">B</font>, and 
  back of button <font color="#CC3333">C</font>, then down and between tension 
  discs <font color="#CC3333">D</font> from right to left, and through the eye 
  of the thread take up spring <font color="#CC3333">E</font>, then up and through 
  the hole in the take up lever <font color="#CC3333">F</font>, and then down 
  and back of thread guide <font color="#CC3333">G</font> on the face plate and 
  on down back of the thread guide H on the needle clamp, then from let to right 
  through the eye of the needle.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO OIL THE MACHINE</font></h3>
<p>The machine must always be kept clean, and every part where there is the least 
  friction should be kept lightly oiled with the best prepared oil in the places 
  indicated in the cuts. Oil the <font color="#CC3333">left point</font> of the 
  <font color="#CC3333">bobbin</font> when being filled. The shuttle should be 
  oiled (only a drop between the shuttle and race way) at least once a day when 
  in constant use. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="02.gif" width="575" height="360"></p>
<p>After the machine has been oiled, run it (with presser foot up and shuttle 
  out) for a minute, then wipe off the superfluous oil. If it runs hard after 
  standing idle for some time, use a little kerosene oil in the usual way and 
  run rapidly; wipe clean, then oil with the best prepared oil, which should always 
  be used.<img src="03.gif" width="278" height="338" align="left" hspace="10"></p>
<p>Recollect that every part where there is any friction should be carefully oiled. 
  Only a small quantity of oil should be used at a time.</p>
<p>The places indicated by the letter O give each friction part of the head which 
  requires lubrication. See Figures 2 and 3.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO OPERATE THE TREADLE</font></h3>
<p align="left">Familiarity with the motion of the treadle is first to be learned,and 
  practice is necessary in order to give a steady and uniform revolution to the 
  driving wheel.</p>
<p align="left">The presser foot, which holds the work in place on the feed, should 
  be raised to prevent the feed from injury by contact with it.</p>
<p align="left">Place the feet on the treadle with the instep directly over the 
  rod upon which the treadle rests. Star the machine by placing the right hand 
  upon the top of the balance wheel and revolving it towards you, taking care 
  to give it impetus enough to keep up a regular movement by pressing alternately 
  with the heel and ball of the foot with equal effect. This should be practiced 
  until a uniform motion of the wheel is obtained.</p>
<p align="left">Do not attempt to sew until you are familiar with the treadle 
  movement.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO PUT IN SHUTTLE</font></h3>
<p align="left">Draw out the front slide, put the shuttle in the carrier or basket 
  (with point towards you), then close the slide. It is sometimes convenient to 
  withdraw the rear slide and put the shuttle in the carrier. This is the case 
  when some of the attachments are in use.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO RUN ON THE BELT</font></h3>
<p align="left">After placing the belt in the groove of the balance wheel, hold 
  it in the notch of the driving wheel and turn the balance wheel towards you. 
  The belt should be run outside of the bobbin winder.</p>
<p align="left">The belt that communicates motion to the machine should always 
  be kept tight enough to move it without slipping. Should it become too loose, 
  cut it to the desired length.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO SET THE NEEDLE</font></h3>
<p align="left">First loosen the screw that clamps the needle and allow the needle 
  bar to rest at its highest point; then take the needle (with flat side of shank 
  toward the needle bar) between the thumb and finger of the left hand; then insert 
  the needle into the groove (as far as it will go) under the clamp and screw 
  fast (observe that the needles pass through the hole in the throat plate without 
  touching either side). </p>
<p align="left">If linen or silk or very coarse cotton is used the needle may 
  be set a little lower than in ordinary sewing.<img src="04.gif" width="291" height="309" align="right"></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO WIND THE BOBBIN</font></h3>
<p align="left">Unlock the balance wheel with the thumb and forefinger of the 
  right hand, by turning the key or center button towards you (this will prevent 
  the machine from wearing and save the trouble and annoyance of unthreading it, 
  and removing the work while the bobbin is being filled).</p>
<p align="left">Then swing the bobbin winder towards you until it presses lightly 
  against the belt.</p>
<p align="left">Place the spool of thread to be wound from on the spindle, and 
  put the bobbin in the bobbin winder.</p>
<p align="left">Pass the thread from the spool under the the hook at the lower 
  end of the bobbin winder distributer. To secure the end of the thread preparatory 
  to winding, place it between the head of the bobbin and its socket at the right 
  hand.</p>
<p align="left">Proceed as in sewing. When the bobbin has been filled swing the 
  bobbin winder from the belt, and turn back the key or Center Button until it 
  locks the balance wheel.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO THREAD THE THE SHUTTLE</font></h3>
<p align="left"><img src="05.gif" width="479" height="188" align="left" hspace="10">Take 
  the shuttle in the left hand with the point toward you; draw off about two inches 
  of thread from the bobbin, thread running from the upper side; then put the 
  bobbin in the shuttle as far as it will go. </p>
<p align="left">Then draw the thread into the open slot of shuttle, at the same 
  time putting thread in the slot and drawing it toward you it will be forced 
  under the point of the shuttle spring.</p>
<p align="left">The tension is regulated by turning the screw in the point of 
  the shuttle to the right or left; to the right to give more tension, to the 
  left to lessen the tension.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">USE OF GAUGE</font></h3>
<p align="left">The gauge is attached to the bed plate by means of a thumb screw. 
  It is used for enabling the operator to sew at a given distance from the edge.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO THREAD THE MACHINE (Upper Thread)</font></h3>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000">Place spool on spool pin <font color="#CC3333">A</font>, 
  lead the thread from the spool under pin <font color="#CC3333">B</font>, and 
  back of button <font color="#CC3333">C</font>, then down and between tension 
  discs <font color="#CC3333">D</font> from right to left, and through the eye 
  of the thread take up spring <font color="#CC3333">E</font>, then up and through 
  the hole in the take up lever <font color="#CC3333">F</font>, and then down 
  and back of thread guide <font color="#CC3333">G</font> on the face plate and 
  on down back of the thread guide H on the needle clamp, then from let to right 
  through the eye of the needle.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO GET THE REQUIRED LENGTH OF STITCH</font></h3>
<p align="left">Unfasten the thumb screw on the front of the arm (at the rear 
  of the bobbin winder) by turning it to the left, then slide it upward for a 
  longer and downward for a shorter stitch.</p>
<p align="left">Tighten the thumb screw firmly so it will not jar loose while 
  operating the machine. The figures indicated on the plate note the number of 
  stitches to the inch the machine will make where the thumb screw is placed.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO DRAW UP SHUTTLE THREAD</font></h3>
<p align="left">Take hold of the balance wheel with one hand and the needle thread 
  with the other, keeping the latter slack, so as not to spring the needle; move 
  the wheel toward you once around and pull up the needle thread with your hand, 
  to draw the shuttle thread through the throat hole. Then take both threads and 
  pass them under the presser foot, toward the back of the machine.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO COMMENCE SEWING</font></h3>
<p align="left">The machine now being fully threaded, above and below, and the 
  shuttle thread drawn up, you are ready to commence sewing. Raise the presser 
  foot by the presser bar lifter, which you will find at the rear of the faceplate 
  (lower end), to the first notch or lift for light fabrics, and to the second 
  notch as far as it will go for heavy work.</p>
<p align="left">Put the work under the presser foot and release the lifter so 
  that the foot will come down upon the work. Avoid pushing or pulling the goods 
  while sewing. Always turn the balance wheel toward you while sewing.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO SEW HEAVY GOODS</font></h3>
<p align="left">Lengthen the stitch in proportion to the thickness of the goods. 
  If goods are very thick, set the needle a little lower than usual. In sewing 
  heavy or hard fabrics greater pressure is required than for light-weight goods. 
  This pressure is regulated by the adjustment nut at the top of the Presser Bar, 
  turning to the right to increase and to the left to decrease the pressure.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO REGULATE THE TENSIONS</font></h3>
<p align="left">After threading the shuttle try the tension by drawing the thread 
  toward the blunt end; if it draws tightly, it is right for goods of firm texture; 
  thin, soft goods require a loose tension. To obtain more or less tension, put 
  more or less pressure on the shuttle tension spring, as described heretofore.</p>
<p align="left">The tension of the top thread is adjusted by the tension screw 
  <font color="#CC3333">D</font>, turning to the right to tighten and to the left 
  to slacken it. Care must be taken in regulating the tension of the upper and 
  lower threads. If the tension on either thread is too tight, it will cause the 
  thread to break and the seams will be puckered. If there is not sufficient tension, 
  the thread will not be brought into the fabric, but will lie in loops on either 
  side. When both tensions are properly adjusted the threads are drawn to the 
  center of the fabric.</p>
<p align="left">The tensions upon both threads should be nearly alike as possible, 
  and tight enough only to make a smooth and firm seam. If the threads are of 
  proper size for the material used and both tensions right the threads will be 
  drawn and locked together in the center of the goods, thus:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="06.gif" width="511" height="80"></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">CAUSE OF THE MACHINE MISSING STITCHES</font></h3>
<p align="left">Should there be at any time be skipped or long stitches at intervals, 
  it is owing to the needle being set too low in very heavy sewing, or its having 
  become bent away from the point of the shuttle, or its being too small for the 
  thread in use, and sometimes to the point of the shuttle becoming accidentally 
  blunted.</p>
<p align="left">When using very fine needles and also stitching heavy work, be 
  sure that the points of the needles are perfect and on a line with the center 
  of the direction of needle, and not blunted or turned over. An imperfect needle 
  will cause the best machine to miss stitches.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO REMOVE THE WORK</font></h3>
<p align="left">Allow the needle to rest at its highest point, raise the presser 
  foot and with the left thumb press on the tension release <font color="#CC3333">B</font> 
  and with the right hand draw the work directly back of the needle</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">HOW TO AFFIX ATTACHMENTS</font></h3>
<p align="left">Loosen the circular thumb nut directly over the presser foot, 
  by turning it towards you, then remove the presser foot from the holder by drawing 
  it towards you, and insert in its place the attachment which you desire to use. 
  Be sure that put such attachment back far enough so as to allow the needle to 
  pass clearly in the needle hole of the attachment and also the throat plate 
  underneath. Then tighten the thumb nut firmly by turning it away from you towards 
  the left. Have the needle at its highest point while making the change.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">GENERAL REMARKS</font></h3>
<p align="left">The presser foot must never be let down on the feed unless you 
  are sewing or have cloth under it.</p>
<p align="left">When the shuttle is in, the machine must not be run with either 
  of the shuttle slides out or partly open, as it is liable to bend or break some 
  portion of the machinery.</p>
<p align="left">Do not allow lint or dust to accumulate in the shuttle or under 
  the shuttle tension spring. Particularly in the inner end of shuttle, as this 
  would prevent the proper action of the bobbin. Also observe the same caution 
  as to the upper tension.</p>
<p align="left">Do not run the machine backward, or with both threads in, without 
  sewing.</p>
<p align="left">Do not use a dull or bent needle, or draw the work, the feed will 
  naturally carry it.</p>
<p align="left">Needles are frequently broken by failing to observe the latter 
  caution.</p>
