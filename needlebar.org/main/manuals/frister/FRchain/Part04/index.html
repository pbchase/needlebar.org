<p align="center"><b><font color="#990000">THE GUIDE</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig08.jpg" width="522" height="416"></p>
<p align="center">Fasten the Guide to Cloth Plate by Guide Screw, as far from 
  the Needle as you wish the sewing to be from edge of the work.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#990000">TO BRAID </font></b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig09.jpg" width="419" height="371"></p>
<p align="center">In the upper side of the Presser Foot you will find a groove 
  crossed by a small wire; insert the braid in this groove under the wire, and 
  draw the end from you under the Presser Foot. All that is now necessary is to 
  turn the cloth, so as to follow any desired pattern, as shown in the above cut 
  (Fig. 9), and the braid will draw through the groove, and be sewed down by the 
  needle and thread. In turning square corners (see direction &quot;To Turn A 
  Corner&quot;, page 9), draw up the braid a little before approaching the corner. 
  Use from 16 to 20 stitches to the inch.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#990000">THE QUILTER </font></b></p>
<p align="center">Fasten Quilter to frame, from behind the Foot Bar, by means 
  of the Guide Screw, and set the blade at such a distance from the Needle as 
  to make the desired space between the rows of stitching, and sufficiently above 
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig10.jpg" width="400" height="383"> </p>
<p align="center">the Cloth Plate to allow the work to pass freely; crease the 
  goods on a true bias through the centre of the work, and sew the first row of 
  stitching on the crease. Move the work to the right until the line of stitching 
  is under the blade of the Quilter, which serves as a guide for the distance 
  between rows.</p>
<p align="center"><i>For Squares, </i>again crease it through the centre on a 
  true bias and proceed as before.</p>
<p align="center"><i>For Diamonds</i>, the <i>cross</i> rows of stitching should 
  be parallel to the edge of the goods.</p>
<p align="center">The Quilter is also used as a top guide for stitching three-ply 
  tucks.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#990000">THE GATHERER </font></b></p>
<p align="center">Place the Gatherer on the Presser Foot, until it touches the 
  Wire on the upper side, as shown above.</p>
<p align="center">Use stitch from 12 to 16 to the inch.</p>
<p align="center">Use No. 40 Cotton (glac&eacute; preferred). See that the Reel 
  turns freely on the Spool Pin.</p>
<p align="center">To Thread (<i>for gathering</i>) leave the cotton out of Pull-off 
  (Fig. 1, No. 1), and draw it direct from the Reel into the groove of the Automatic 
  Tension (Fig. 1, No. 2), then Thread the Pin (Fig. 1, No. 3), &amp;c., as usual.</p>
<p align="center">Place the work in the ordinary way, and allow it to feed freely.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig11.jpg" width="338" height="379"></p>
<p align="center"><i>If it does not gather full enough</i>, lengthen the stitch; 
  or increase the tension, by taking hold of the thread between the Automatic 
  Tension (2, Fig. 1), and the Thread Pin (3, Fig. 1), and, winding it once oftener 
  in groove of Tension - with Needle at highest point - not more than three times 
  in all. <i>If too full</i>, shorten stitch, or unwind extra coil of thread from 
  Tension.</p>
<p align="center">The fulness of gathering depends on softness of goods, length 
  of stitch and tightness of tension.</p>
<p align="center">For Nainsook, sixteen stitches to the inch, and no extra turns 
  of thread around Tension, or at most one turn, will answer.</p>
<p align="center">For Calico, twelve stitches to the inch, and three turns around 
  Tension may be required.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#990000">TO GATHER AND SEW ON BAND AT THE SAME 
  TIME</font></b> </p>
<p align="center">Put gatherer on Presser Foot. Thread as for ordinary sewing, 
  with No. 60 or 70 cotton, using twelve stitches to the inch. Put the piece to 
  be gathered under the band, holding band with right hand and under piece with 
  left.</p>
<p align="center">Hold back band, so that feed can only make short stitches.</p>
<p align="center">The fulness and regularity of gathering depend entirely upon 
  the skill of operator in holding band.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#990000">TO EMBROIDER</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig12.jpg" width="400" height="423"></p>
<p align="center">Use a No. 4 needle and E or F silk.* Thread as usual, but pass 
  the thread from back to front through the Embroidery Spring, after threading 
  through the Staple (4, Fig. 1).</p>
<p align="center">* E silk is equal to No. 10. <i>See</i> page 6.</p>
<p align="center">When the fabric is very thin, 12 stitches to the inch may tend 
  to pucker the work; if so, shorten to 13 or 14. With very thin material, it 
  is well to trace the pattern on paper and tack it to the work on the wrong side.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#990000">NARROW HEMMER </font></b></p>
<p align="center">Fasten the Narrow Hemmer to the Cloth Plate with the Hemmer 
  Nut. Raise Presser Foot, and, without any folding, pass the edge of fabric to 
  be hemmed between the blades. With a Needle push forward </p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig13.jpg" width="308" height="400"></p>
<p align="center">the goods, until the front edge is under the needle. Let down 
  the Presser Foot, and proceed, keeping the edge of the goods against the edge 
  of the Hemmer.</p>
<p align="center">As the fabric passes through the Hemmer, the fingers placed 
  against it, it makes it run out <i>straight</i> to the end of hem.</p>
<p align="center">If it is necessary to take the material out of the Hemmer before 
  finishing, without letting it feed through, raise the Presser <br>
  Foot and pull the work <i>from you</i>; not backwards or sideways, or you will 
  injure the Hemmer.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig14.jpg" width="400" height="376"></p>
<p align="center">In hemming, use the next larger stitch to that indicated by 
  the &quot;table&quot; on the Cloth Plate, thus for 70 cotton use 20 stitches 
  to the inch, instead of 22, as the feeding is retarded somewhat by the Hemmer. 
</p>
<p align="center">The Hemmer Blades should never be bent.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#990000">TO MAKE NARROW HEM AND SEW ON TRIMMING 
  AT THE SAME TIME</font></b> </p>
<p align="center">Place edge of trimming between hem and feed surface, guiding 
  with the finger, so as to stitch edge fast beneath hem; or, place edge of trimming 
  over the Narrow Hemmer and through the opening in the Presser Foot, thus stitching 
  the trimming to the top of the hem.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#990000">THE FELLER AND WIDE HEMMER</font></b> 
</p>
<p align="center">The Feller is useful in making underclothing, as it turns a 
  beautifully neat and uniform fell, no tacking or fixing being required. It may 
  also be used as a Hemmer when a wider hem is required than those turned by the 
  Hemmers already described.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#990000">TO MAKE A WIDE HEM</font></b> </p>
<p align="center">The edge to be hemmed should be cut instead of torn; for if 
  the edge is stretched through being torn, or otherwise, the material where the 
  seam is sewn must be stretched to an equal length. The material </p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig15.jpg" width="347" height="400"></p>
<p align="center">must be folded down evenly, and distinctly creased with a wider 
  than the width of hem desired. The edge is then placed in the Hemmer (Fig. 15), 
  the lower fold entering under the upper blade and upper fold passing over it. 
  The edge of the material is kept up against the turn of the blade during the 
  process of stitching the hem.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig16.jpg" width="400" height="333"></p>
<p align="center">This is generally done by the aid of the guide, as shown in 
  Fig. 16, which serves to guide the work, and holds the edge in the Hemmer.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#990000">TO MAKE A FELLED SEAM</font></b> </p>
<p align="center">Lay the two pieces one upon the other, the under piece projecting 
  beyond the upper. Sew them together with the Machine, allowing for a hem of 
  such width as will be suitable to the material. Turn the work over, open it 
  out and crease the seam down with the narrow edge inside. Then attach the Feller 
  and insert the edge as in Fig. 15; hold the seam, where it is joined, well up 
  against the side of the blade of the Feller (Fig. 17); keep it in this position, 
  as the work passes through, guiding it gently against the blade of the Feller 
  with the first finger of the right hand; at the same time with the left hand 
  keep the work smooth, and gently guide it towards the left.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig17.jpg" width="369" height="400"></p>
<p align="center">The first seam of a fell on the bias should always be begun 
  from the narrow end of the work.</p>
<p align="center">If the Feller does not turn in all the raw edge of the material, 
  the seam is too wide.</p>
