<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO COMMENCE SEWING</font></b></h3>
<h2 align="center"><img src="09.jpg" width="350" height="364"></h2>
<p align="center">Have both threads passed under the presser foot at the side 
  (see Fig 9), place the cloth under the presser foot, and let down the presser 
  lifter. Start the machine by turning the balance wheel from you. Do not pull 
  or push the work, the machine moves it.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO REGULATE THE TENSIONS</font></b></h3>
<h2 align="center"><img src="10.jpg" width="451" height="105"></h2>
<p align="center">For ordinary stitching the upper and under threads should be 
  locked in the center of the thickness of the material as shown in Fig 10.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="11.jpg" width="416" height="103"></p>
<p align="center">If the upper thread is held too tightly by its tension, or if 
  the under thread is too loose, the thread will lie straight along the upper 
  surface of the material as shown in Fig 11.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="12.jpg" width="417" height="103"></p>
<p align="center">If the under tension is too tight or the upper tension too loose, 
  the thread will lie straight along the under side of the material as shown in 
  Fig.12</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TENSION ON UPPER THREAD</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Regulate the tension of the upper thread by turning the top 
  of the tension nut toward you to tighten, the other way to loosen the tension 
  (B, <a href="index.html#7">see Fig 7</a>). When the presser foot lifter is down 
  the upper tension may be teasted by hand. Do not try to adjust the upper tension 
  when the presser lifter is up. When making a very long stitch, the best tension 
  is obtained by using the coarse throat plate instead of the fine one which is 
  usually in the machine.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="13.jpg" width="350" height="254"></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TENSION ON UNDER THREAD</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">To regulate the under tension, remove the bed slide (front), 
  turn the machine until the hook points toward you and the hook gib is below 
  the latch (see Fig 13). The tension is regulated by the screw in the center 
  of the spring above the latch. With the small screw driver turn this screw one-quarter 
  or one-half around to the right to tighten, or to the left to loosen the tension. 
  The under tension, when once regulated, will rarely require any change, therefore, 
  the proper relation of upper and under tension should be produced by changes 
  of the upper tension only. For general work the tension on the under thread 
  should be medium.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO TURN A CORNER</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Stop the machine while the needle is rising, but before it is 
  out of the material, raise the presser foot and turn the corner, using the needle 
  as a pivot.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO REMOVE THE WORK</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">To remove the work, raise the presser lifter; turn the balance 
  wheel from you until the point of the needle going down reaches the presser 
  foot, bringing the take-up lever to its highest position. Draw the work from 
  you until you can draw the threads into the thread cutter. If the threads do 
  not draw out easily, the needle is not in position, as directed. If the machine 
  is stopped and held as directed, the needle will not unthread when you start 
  to sew if only a short end is left through the needle. For convenience in taking 
  out the work, the tension of the upper thread is released whenever the presser 
  lifter is raised, but it is not released by the rising of the presser foot a 
  thick goods or seams pass under the presser foot.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">FOR SEWING BIAS SEAMS OR VERY ELASTIC 
  MATERIAL</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">In sewing, if elasticity is required, as on bias seams or very 
  elastic material, hold the work back slightly, while sewing, to keep the cloth 
  stretched.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO ALTER THE LENGTH OF STITCH</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">The length of stitch is regulated by the feed regulating thumb 
  nut, at the base of the arm. Loosen the thumb nut and push it to the right to 
  lengthen, or to the left to shorten the stitch, then tighten it firmly.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO CHANGE THE PRESSURE OF THE PRESSER 
  FOOT</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Turn the large presser bar thumb screw (G, <a href="index.html#7">see 
  Fig 7</a>) to the right to make the pressure heavier, or to the left to make 
  it lighter; the pressure should be only heavy enough to prevent the material 
  rising with the needle and to insure the feed moving the work along evenly; 
  a heavier pressure would make the machine run harder and be of no benefit.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO OIL THE MACHINE AND STAND</font></b></h3>
<h2 align="center"><img src="14.jpg" width="600" height="412"></h2>
<p align="center">Oil at all places indicated by arrows and wherever there is 
  friction. Good oil is the life of a machine and should be regularly used on 
  any surface of metal which comes in movable contact with another surface. There 
  are four holes for oil in the upper surface of the arm, one near the balance 
  wheel, one above the take-up lever hinge and screw, one large and one small 
  oil hole back of the needle bar. Oil through the large hole when the needle 
  bar is at its lowest point to oil the groove in the cam for the take-up lever 
  roller.</p>
<p align="center">Put a drop of oil in the oil hole under the arm near its base 
  to oil the hook shaft bearing (back) and a drop of oil into the hole in the 
  bed slide (back) to oil the hook shaft bearing (front). Move the arm cap, which 
  is near the balance wheel, to one side and oil the connection which drives the 
  hook shaft, also insert the oil can spout into the large hole below the balance 
  wheel to oil the slide which guides the connection. Loosen the balance wheel 
  nut and oil the loose pulley which permits the belt to wind the bobbin without 
  running the machine (<a href="index.html#4">see Fig 4</a>).</p>
<p align="center">The parts on the under side of the machine may best be cleaned 
  and oiled by removing the belt and tipping the machine back as shown in Fig 
  14. Remove the face plate by loosening the large screw near tension pulley (B, 
  <a href="index.html#7">see Fig 7</a>), raise the face plate and slip it off 
  over the head of the screw, within the space thus uncovered can be seen the 
  needle bar and its connecting link, the presser bar and the mechanism that operates 
  the take-up lever; put one drop of oil into each of the oil holes and joints, 
  also upon the needle bar and presser bar where they enter the holes into which 
  they are fitted. A very little oil must be occasionally put uopn the edge of 
  the bobbin case, with an oiled rag to prevent a clicking sound (<a href="#16">see 
  Fig 16</a>)</p>
<p align="center">The stand must be oiled at each end of the pitman and hand wheel 
  shaft. After oiling, raise the presser foot and run the machine rapidly a minute; 
  then wipe off all superfluous oil, to prevent soiling the goods. If the machine 
  runs hard at any time, it is certain that some part needs oiling. Never run 
  the machine with the presser foot down, except when sewing, as it will scratch 
  and dull the feed points.</p>
<p align="center">If the machine has been standing a long time without use, benzine 
  should be used to dissolve and clean out the old oil; then run the machine rapidly 
  a few moments, or until it runs freely, wipe clean and then oil as above directed 
  <img src="15.jpg" width="287" height="325" align="left" vspace="20" hspace="20">with 
  a fresh sewing machine oil put up by The Singer Manufacturing Company.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO CLEAN THE FEED</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Remove the needle, presser foot and thoat plate. Clean all of 
  the parts about the feed bar, hook and bobbin case, and oil all of the parts 
  where there is friction.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO ADJUST THE FEED DOG</font></h3>
<p align="center">Should the feed dog or feed bar become worn by long use, leaving 
  the points too low, they may be raised by turning the middle screw to the right. 
  Turning the screw to the left will lower them (see arrow point in Fig 15). The 
  points should rise about one-thirty-second of an inch above the plate, or enough 
  to raise the hemmer slightly when it is in the machine.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000"><a name="16"></a>TO REMOVE THE PRESSER 
  FOOT</font></h3>
<p align="center">Raise the presser lifter and loosen screw (T-B, <a href="#9">see 
  Fig 9</a>), then draw the presser foot down and out.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="16.jpg" width="542" height="324"></p>
<p align="center">Fig 16 shows the gib open, and the heel of the hook in line 
  with the second notch in the bobbin case, which position allows the bobbin case 
  to be lifted out easily.<img src="17.jpg" width="300" height="270" align="right" vspace="20" hspace="20"></p>
<p align="center">To remove the bobbin case from the hook to thoroughly clean 
  the bobbin case and hook, turn the balance wheel until the heel of the hook 
  is in line with the second notch in the bobbin case, remove the screw at the 
  end of the hook gob, and open the hook gib, as shown in Fig 16, then lift out 
  the bobbin case.</p>
<p align="center">The back of the bobbin case should be kept clean to prevent 
  soiling the thread or obstructing the loop. See that there is no lint or dirt 
  under the tension spring (see Fig 17).</p>
<p align="center">When returning the bobbin case to the hook, be sure to have 
  the horn in the notch of the bobbin case case stop bar, and the second notch 
  of the case at the heel of the hook, then close the hook gib and turn the screw 
  in firmly. Be careful not to damage the head of the screw.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO CHANGE THE PRESSURE OF THE THREAD 
  CONTROLLER SPRING</font></h3>
<p align="center">The function of the thread controller spring is to hold back 
  the slack of the upper thread until the eye of the needle reaches the goods 
  in its descent.</p>
<p align="center">If the pressure of the spring on the thread is too weak or too 
  strong, remove the face plate, loosen the stud set screw near (C, <a href="index.html#7">see 
  Fig 7</a>) and turn the stud to increase or decrease the pressure of the spring 
  on the thread and tighten the stud set screw to hold the stud in the position 
  desired. For general work the spring is set correctly at the factory.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO PUT IN A THREAD CONTROLLER SPRING</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Remove the entire thread controller by taking out screw (H, 
  <a href="index.html#7">see Fig 7</a>); then take out screw (I, be careful not 
  to lose the small roller) and you will find the spring is released; carefully 
  note the way the spring comes out. Place the new spring in its position aand 
  put back the screw. Next put the entire thread controller and spring on the 
  machine, taking particular care to slide the little tail, which you will find 
  on the coil of the spring, into the notch in the stud over which the spring 
  slides. Do not under any circumstances alter any other screws or adjustments. 
  The small roller should be oiled occasionally.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">NEEDLES</font></h3>
<p align="center">Needles for machines of Class 9w are of Class and Variety 9 
  N 1 and are made in sizes suitable for the different sizes of thread commonly 
  used. The number of the needle is marked upon the shank.</p>
<p align="center">Orders for needled must specify the <i>quantity</i> required, 
  the <i>size</i>, also the <i>class</i> and <i>variety</i> numbers separated 
  by N. The following are details of an intelligible order: &quot;One Doz. No. 
  4 - 9 N 1 Needles&quot;</p>

</table>
<p align="center">For ordinary work use the same size of thread in the bobbin 
  as in the needle. In using slack twist or uneven silk, should it be frayed or 
  roughened, the needle is too fine or too sharp, or has a hooked point, made 
  by striking the throat plate. A hook may be easily honed off the needle.</p>
<p align="center">To make a smooth, even stitch with your machine, it is necessary 
  to use good, firmly twisted and smoothly finished thread, that passes freely 
  through the eye of the needle. No other needles will give as good results and 
  satisfaction as those recommended above.</p>
<p align="center">Supplies of parts or needles for the machine can be purchased 
  at any Singer shop, or ordered by mail; money, or post office order covering 
  their value, including postage should be enclosed with the order, which will 
  then receive immediate attention, and be promptly filled and forwarded by mail 
  or express.</p>
