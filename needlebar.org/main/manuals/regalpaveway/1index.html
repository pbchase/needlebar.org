  <p><b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">TO THREAD THE MACHINE</font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#660000">Place the spool on the spool pin<b> A, </b>pass the 
	thread under the curved point of the upper tension spring <b>B</b>, drawing 
	it between the two springs unto the little notch in the center of the under 
	spring at <b>C</b>. By holding back on the thread with the right hand while 
	drawing it between the springs with the left, the pressure of the springs 
	will readily be overcome. If you attempt to draw the thread through the springs 
	with one hand you will be apt to break it. Always have the thread pass back 
	of the tension screw <b>D</b>. Next pass it under the little spring thread 
	guide marked <b>E</b> on top of the arm, then through the slot in the top 
	of the needle bar <b>F</b>. Pass a loop of the thread through the take-up 
	staple <b>G</b>. From the front toward the back, slipping the loop over the 
	end of the take-up <b>H</b>, then under the wire thread guide <b>I</b> on 
	needle clamp, then carry the thread through the eye of the needle from left 
	to right, leaving two or three inches extended.</font></p>
  <p><b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">TO REMOVE THE SHUTTLE</font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#660000">Draw out the front slide plate, turn the machine until 
	the shuttle is nearest the operator, then carefully remove it from its carrier. 
	Do not try to pry it out with the point of a screw driver or any thing that 
	will be apt to injure or bend the shuttle spring.</font></p>
  <p><b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">TO CHANGE THE SELF-SETTING NEEDLE</font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#660000">To take the needle out, raise the needle-bar to its 
	highest point, loosen the needle clamp screw by a slight turn towards you, 
	and slip the needle down until it is free.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000">To set the needle, take it in the left hand, placing 
	the point through the hole in the needle plate and pass it up into the bar, 
	and be sure you push it up as far as it will go, with the long groove of the 
	needle to your left and the short groove and the flattened shank to the right.</font></p>
  <p><b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">TO THREAD THE SHUTTLE</font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#660000">Hold the shuttle in the left hand with the point toward 
	you. Drop the bobbin into the shuttle <b>so that the thread in sewing will 
	draw from the upper side</b>, then draw the thread into the open slot towards 
	you, at the same time putting a little pressure with your finger upon the 
	end of the bobbin so it cannot turn, the thread will be forced under the lip 
	of the shuttle spring; the shuttle is then threaded ready for use.</font></p>
  <p><img src="fig2.jpg" width="510" height="267"></p>
  <p>Place the shuttle in the carrier point first then towards you, and hold the 
	end of the upper thread loosely by the left hand, turn the fly wheel once 
	around, when the two threads will have become interlocked and can be drawn 
	through the needle plate by an upward movement of the hand. Pass the two thread 
	ends back from you, put the slides into their places over the shuttle, turn 
	the hand wheel until the needle is raised to hits highest point, then put 
	the goods under the presser foot, and drop it down. Now see that the shuttle 
	slides are both closed over the shuttle and the machine is ready to commence 
	sewing.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">TO GET REQUIRED LENGTH OF STITCH</font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#660000">On the front part of the upright arm will be found 
	the stitch index. Unfasten the thumb screw by turning it slightly to the left, 
	then slide it upward for longer, and downward for a shorter stitch, turning 
	the thumb screw up first, so it will not jar loose while operating the machine. 
	The stitch index is marked with figures corresponding with the number of stitches 
	to the inch the machine will make when the thumb screw is set opposite.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">SKIPPED STITCHES</font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#660000">These are sometimes caused by the needle being too 
	small for the thread, or not being set up as high in the bar as it will go. 
	Also by the needle being bent, or by dirt or lint collecting in the groove 
	cut for the needle in the face of the shuttle race; also by needle being set 
	in wrong with long groove toward shuttle - <b>always have short groove towards 
	the shuttle.</b></font> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">TO REMOVE THE WORK</font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#660000">Allow the needle to rest at its highest point. Raise 
	the presser foot - press down the lever on tension which will release all 
	pressure on the upper thread - then draw two or three inches of slack thread 
	through the tension between it and spring thread guide (<b>C</b> and <b>E</b> 
	figure 1). Then with the left hand draw the work from the left side backward 
	and bring both threads over the back so that they will be drawn across the 
	little knife of the thread cutter and cut.</font></p>
