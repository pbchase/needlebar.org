    the plain iron guide cannot be used in consequence of the width of the work. 
    Should the end of wire be either too large or too small to fit accurately, 
    it can be adjusted to the proper size by either slightly opening or compressing 
    the end of the wire which is split for this purpose. This attachment will 
    also quilt.</p>

    it backwards and forwards once, with the right hand, gently drawing the cloth 
    into the mouth of the Hemmer, then turn the Presser foot by the tightly held 
    cloth, when down the sewing may be commenced; care should be taken that the 
    cloth always fills the furl of the Hemmer.</p>
