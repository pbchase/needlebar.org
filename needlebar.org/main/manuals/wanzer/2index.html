  <p><b>SEWING MACHINES.</b></p>
  <p><b>__________</b></p>
  <p><b>SETTING THE NEEDLE</b></p>
  <p align="justify">Set the needle with its head or shank in the needle yoke 
    <b>A,</b> with its eye ranging from left to right, with long groove to the 
    left; secure it by screwing up the centre screw <b>B</b>, at the lower end 
    of needle bar <b>E</b>. Set the needle so that in its descent it will pass 
    through the centre of the needle hole and pass as close as possible to the 
    left of the shuttle without touching it, and its eye about 3/16th of an inch 
    below the point of shuttle, so that shuttle will enter the loop of thread 
    formed at the right side of the needle on its rise. If the thread is improperly 
    twisted it may throw the loop one side instead of square into the shuttle 
    race. In that case the needle should be slightly turned in an opposite direction, 
    to counteract this tendency to throw the loop away from its proper position. 
    Sometimes the shuttle will miss the loop because the needle sets too far from 
    the shuttle, and at other times the shuttle may strike the needle because 
    the needle sets into the shuttle race. To adjust the needle nearer to or father 
    from the shuttle, turn the two frout screws, <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>, on the 
    end of needle bar <b>E</b>, in or out as the needle requires to be nearer 
    to or father from the shuttle. Care should be taken to turn both screws the 
    same, otherwise the needle will not be in a straight line with the needle 
    bar.</p>
  <p align="justify">Turn the hand wheel <b>P</b> so that the mark on front edge 
    of needle bar <b>E</b> will be even with top of arm; then the eye of needle, 
    if properly set, should be on a level with plate.</p>
  <p><b>THREADING THE NEEDLE</b></p>
  <p align="justify">Place the spool on spool-pin or wire <b>G</b>, on top of 
    the arm of machine, so that it will turn freely. Pass the thread backwards 
    and forwards through the five holes in thread guide <b>H</b>, passing it through 
    the first hole of thread guide from the far side, so that the thread, in passing 
    through the fifth hole, will be drawn to the front. Pass the thread over the 
    top and round the tension wheel <b>J</b>, letting the thread lie in the V 
    shaped groove formed by the interlocked teeth of the tension wheel, passing 
    it <i>once</i> around the wheel. If the thread is fine, or should slip without 
    turning the wheel, pass it <i>twice</i> around the wheel. Pass the thread 
    thence through wire eyelet <b>K</b>, from right to left, down through the 
    hole in the end of the take-up lever L, from right to left; thence up through 
    the tube <b>M</b>, on top of needle bar <b>E</b>, and down through eye of 
    needle, from left to right, letting the thread rest in slot in needle clamp, 
    leaving three inches of thread.</p>
  <p><b>THREADING THE SHUTTLE</b></p>
  <p align="justify">In working, the bobbin <b>T</b> revolves inside the shuttle. 
    The operator must be careful to place bobbin properly inside shuttle. On the 
    inside of shuttle, at the front or forward end, is a centre, acted upon by 
    a spring; into this one point of the bobbin should be placed, with the thread 
    drawing off from the lower side, then press the other point of bobbin in at 
    heel of shuttle, pushing it down gently until a slight snap is heard, or until 
    it enters the small hole or bearing. The thread must be then passed up through 
    the slot farthest from edge of the shuttle, and down through the upper slot, 
    thence through the hole nearest back or heel end of the shuttle, then in through 
    hole nearest point of shuttle and lastly out through short slot under the 
    spring. Should a greater tension than this would give be required, thread 
    through five instead of three holes, being careful always to pass the thread 
    out of the short slot last, leaving an end of thread three inches long.</p>
  <p><b>SPOOLING THE LOWER THREAD</b></p>
  <p align="justify">Place the spooler attachment <b>N</b> on the top of outside 
    connection. Turn the balance wheel of machine so that the small wheel of spooler 
    will be even with the belt groove in balance wheel <b>F</b>. Pass the belt 
    from groove in balance wheel <b>F</b> to groove on the pulley wheel. Place 
    one end of the bobbin in spooler spindle <b>N</b>, the other end in the point 
    in the centre of spring, and having attached the thread, work the machine 
    the same as when sewing. Oil the spooler spindle and point of bobbin, working 
    in point of spring, before using. Care should be taken in winding bobbin to 
    lay the thread on as evenly and tightly as possible.</p>
  <p><b>REGULATING THE TENSION</b></p>
  <p align="justify">Care must be taken in regulating the tension of lower and 
    upper threads. Produce tension enough on the upper thread to draw the lower 
    loop or lock into the fabric by turning the nut <b>O</b> on tension wire. 
    If the tension be too tight the thread will break or the fabric will be gathered; 
    if not sufficiently tight the loop or lock will not be drawn up into the fabric, 
    but will lie in a succession of loops on the under side of fabric.</p>
  <p align="justify">To increase the tension turn the nut towards the right. To 
    lessen the tension, turn the nut towards the left.</p>
  <p><b>TO REGULATE THE STITCH</b></p>
  <p align="justify">The machine feeds the fabric through itself, the operator 
    only guides it. To make a long stitch, press down the lever <b>P</b>, at the 
    right hand side underneath machine, To make a short stitch raise lever up.</p>
  <p><b>TO SEW</b></p>
  <p align="justify">Be seated before the machine. Withdraw the back slide which 
    rests over shuttle, turn balance wheel until the points on shuttle carrier 
    are visible, place the shuttle between the two points, with point of shuttle 
    to the front. Close the slide. Place one or both feet upon the sandals; start 
    the machine by turning the balance wheel <b>F</b> towards you with the hand 
    - never turn it backwards. Raise the needle bar <b>E</b> by turning the wheel. 
    Raise the presser foot by lifting the lever <b>R</b> attached to the presser 
    bar in front of the machine, place the fabric beneath it. Let the presser 
    foot drop upon the fabric to be sewed.</p>
  <table width="85%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">

    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td height="20"><div align="justify">1. Before attempting to sew, learners 
          should make themselves perfectly familiar with the foot motion. In practising 
          raise the presser foot by lever <b>R</b> that the teeth of feed will 
          not scratch the same. Take out the shuttle, unthread the needle, place 
          both feet upon the sandals, start the machine by turning the wheel towards 
          you with the right hand, adapting the feet to the motion. Learners should 
          practice turning the machine, starting and stopping the same until a 
          perfect forward motion is obtained; a reverse or backward motion will 
          entangle or break the thread.</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><div align="justify">2. The upper thread should pass through the eye 
          of the needle from left to right, the ends of the same being about three 
          inches in length. The shuttle is then to be placed in the shuttle carrier 
          by removing back or sliding place <b>S</b>, the point of the shuttle 
          towards the operator. The same length of thread to be left as from the 
          needle. Make the revolution of the wheel, so that the needle will descend 
          and the threads interlock. By then gently drawing on the upper thread 
          you will be enabled to bring the under one though the needle hole in 
          the throat place, so that both will be together between plate and presser 
          foot.</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><div align="justify">3. When a seam is completed draw the upper thread 
          from spool with the left hand; detach the same close to the fabric; 
          let it extend through the eye of the needle (about three inches) a proper 
          length for starting; raise the presser foot, take out the work, and 
          detach the under thread, leaving the same through needle hole in cloth 
          plate. Attention to this suggestion will prevent springing and breaking 
          of needles, especially the finer sizes.</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><div align="justify">4. The feed carries the fabric along, and the operator 
          as a general ruse should neither assist it with the right hand nor retard 
          it with the left, but allow it to pass at will, holding and guiding 
          it steadily.</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><div align="justify">5. A little care in arranging the tension will 
          produce a perfect stitch on both sides. Heavy fabrics usually require 
          more tension than others. Should loops occur on the under side, first 
          ascertain whether you have threaded the machine properly, then gradually 
          increase the tension by turning the nut <b>O</b> towards the right until 
          the loops are drawn up and the stitch assumes the same appearance on 
          both sides.</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><div align="justify">6. Missed stitches are occasioned either by the 
          needle being set too high or too low, or so as to descend too far to 
          the left of the needle hole. </div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><div align="justify">7. Should there be any difficulty in driving the 
          needle through thick fabrics (if the needle is not blunted), it will 
          be caused by the belt having stretched and slipped on the balance wheel. 
          This may be remedied by cutting a piece off the belt and making a new 
          hole where the ends are clasped together.</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><div align="justify">8. With a machine it is not necessary to use as 
          coarse cottons or silks as for hand sewing, two threads being used instead 
          of one. As a general rule the size of thread for the material to be 
          sewed should first be determined, then care should be taken to make 
          the proper adaptation of needles.</div></td>

  <p><b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">THE MACHINE SHOULD BE KEPT CLEAN</font></b></p>
  <p align="justify">Care should be taken that the running parts of the machine

    time, and these should be supplied more frequently to those parts having the 
    greatest motions, such as the needle bar, the main shaft, shuttle driver, 
    slide, &amp;c. None but the best oils should be used; pure sperm oil is excellent 
    for sewing machines. Should the machine become gummy and run heavy this will 
    be from the use of impure oil or from want of proper cleaning. Spirits of 
    turpentine or kerosene will be useful in cleaning away gummy material.</p>
