<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">To Place the Work and Begin Sewing</font></h3>
<p align="center">Raise Needle to its <i><font color="#CC3333">highest point</font></i>, 
  also <font color="#CC3333">Presser Foot</font>. Place work under point of Needle. 
  Have two or three inches of thread drawn through the eye of Needle (NOTE -- 
  unless the Needle Bar is at its <i><font color="#CC3333">highest point</font></i>, 
  the thread is held by the Automatic Tension, and cannot be drawn through).</p>
<p align="center">Pass thread under <font color="#CC3333">Presser Foot</font>, 
  towards the left. Let down the <font color="#CC3333">Presser Foot</font>, the 
  thread being held fast between the <font color="#CC3333">Presser Foot</font> 
  and Cloth.</p>
<p align="center">The thread may be held lightly under the finger, instead of 
  being passed under the Presser Foot, in which case, hold it until <i><font color="#CC3333">two 
  stitches</font> </i>are made. If held too tightly, the thread will break at 
  the first stitch. </p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">Crossing Seams</font></h3>
<p align="center">The Automatic Sewing Machine will give no trouble in passing 
  over any ordinary seam. Very heavy seams may need a little assistance.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">To Fasten Seam and to Take the Work Out</font></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#CC3333">To Fasten the End of Seam</font> -- Sew 
  off end of seam <i><font color="#CC3333">two stitches</font>:</i> more than 
  this may leave seam unlocked. Stop with Needle at its <i><font color="#CC3333">highest 
  point</font>. </i>With left hand, catch thread between Needle and Thread Pin 
  (6, Fig 9), and pull some slack through the Automatic Tension. With right hand, 
  draw the slack through the eye of Needle, and, grasping thread firmly, cut the 
  thread close to the goods. Lift <font color="#CC3333">Presser Foot</font> and 
  then pull the goods <i><font color="#CC3333">from you</font>,</i> and end of 
  thread will be drawn through the loop. Next, <i><font color="#CC3333">pull end 
  of thread, which will tighten the knot and fasten off the seam</font>.</i> If 
  you cannot pull any slack thread from the spool, it is because the <font color="#CC3333">Needle 
  Bar</font> is <i><font color="#CC3333">not</font> </i>at its highest point.</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#CC3333">To Fasten Seam in the Goods<font color="#000000"> 
  -- Stop the Needle <i><font color="#CC3333">in</font></i> the goods, place the 
  fingers on the goods close to <font color="#CC3333">Presser Foot</font> to prevent 
  goods from moving, raise <font color="#CC3333">Presser Foot</font>, and take 
  one more stitch <i><font color="#CC3333">in last hole made</font></i>. Then 
  break off thread, take out goods and fasten off as directed in preceding paragraph.</font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#CC3333">To Fasten Seam to be Trimmed or Cut<font color="#000000"> 
  -- Seams that you wish to trim from the <i><font color="#CC3333">finishing end</font></i> 
  should be fastened by sewing back in the same row of stitching, a little beyond 
  the point of trimming. If it is necessary to trim the finishing end of a seam 
  that has not been fastened as above, immediately after cutting, lock the seam 
  by inserting a pin through loop on under side of goods, pulling end of thread 
  through and drawing it backward upon the seam.</font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#CC3333">To Take Out Seam<font color="#000000"> 
  -- It is one of the decided advantages of the Automatic Sewing Machine, that, 
  if required, its work can be taken to pieces, without injuring the goods, by 
  simply unlocking the seam at any point, and drawing out the thread. The seam 
  can only be take out in one direction, viz: towards the point of starting. It 
  is therefore a good plan to begin all seams from the end most exposed.</font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#CC3333">To Turn a Corner<font color="#000000"> 
  -- Stop with Needle raised to its <i><font color="#CC3333">highest point</font>;</i> 
  raise <font color="#CC3333">Presser Foot</font> and turn the work. As the thread 
  acts as a pivot the work will become displaced from the position where the Needle 
  was withdrawn; therefore, readjust the work so that the Needle will enter it 
  at proper distance from last stitch. Let <font color="#CC3333">Presser Foot</font> 
  down, and proceed.</font></font></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">Difficulties of Beginners</font></h3>
<p align="center">As in all things &quot;Practice makes perfect&quot;, so in the 
  operation of the Willcox &amp; Gibbs Automatic Sewing Machine, all the varied 
  kinds of work which can be done on it will be accomplished with ease and in 
  perfection as you daily grow more accustomed to its use while closely following 
  this book of instructions. When in trouble arising from inexperience or failure 
  to observe these directions, the following important features should be specially 
  observed:</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3333">&quot;It will not feed&quot;<font color="#000000"> 
  -- STITCH REGULATOR not set according to &quot;Table&quot; on CLOTH PLATE. Thread 
  wound on LOOPER. Needle bent. Threads or ravellings caught on PRESSER FOOT. 
  Cloth caught in HEMMER or other attachment. Very heavy seams will not pass under 
  PRESSER FOOT without a little assistance (See &quot;Crossing Seams&quot;).</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3333">&quot;It ravels when I take the work out&quot;<font color="#000000"> 
  -- Stop Machine with Needle at its <i><font color="#CC3333">highest point</font> 
  </i>and before it runs off the cloth more than two stitches. <i><font color="#CC3333">Never</font></i> 
  turn Machine backward to raise Needle. This precaution will leave last stitch 
  always locked.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3333">&quot;It drops stitches&quot;<font color="#000000"> 
  -- Needle is bent, or not right size for thread according to &quot;Table&quot;; 
  or you are using <i><font color="#CC3333">soft finished</font></i> cotton.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3333">&quot;The thread breaks&quot;<font color="#000000"> 
  -- Machine is not threaded up right. You did not start according to instructions. 
  You are sewing goods too hard for Needle to penetrate without soaping, or you 
  are using wrong sized Needle for the thread; black or colored <i><font color="#CC3333">soft 
  finished</font></i> cotton; or the thread is caught on spool or wound around 
  SPOOL PIN; or Automatic Tension does not hold the thread (See &quot;Tension 
  does not work&quot; below)</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3333">&quot;The Looper winds up&quot;<font color="#000000"> 
  -- Caused either by not holding on to end of thread in starting, or by not putting 
  thread under PRESSER FOOT; or leaving PRESSER FOOT up; or stitch not right by 
  &quot;Table&quot;. When this difficulty occurs pull down the Cap and clear thread 
  from LOOPER, being careful not to scratch LOOPER.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3333">&quot;It runs hard&quot;<font color="#000000"> 
  -- Machine or Stand needs oiling, or you have been using poor oil that gums. 
  Thread or ravellings are wound in between SMALL WHEEL and CONNECTION ROD -- 
  this can occur <i><font color="#CC3333">only</font></i> with our <i><font color="#CC3333">earlier</font></i> 
  AUTOMATIC and B-Machines. All our <i><font color="#CC3333">latest</font></i> 
  AUTOMATIC Sewing Machines have been so improved that this difficulty is entirely 
  removed.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3333">&quot;Wheel turns backward&quot;<font color="#000000"> 
  -- There is oil on rim of LARGE WHEEL (See directions for preventing Wheel turning 
  backward).</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3333">&quot;Belt slips&quot;<font color="#000000"> 
  -- See directions to Tighten the Belt.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3333">&quot;Sewing is much too loose&quot;<font color="#000000"> 
  -- You have a shorter stitch than required by &quot;Table&quot; or you have 
  threaded through EMBROIDERY SPRING; or you have not drawn thread between the 
  Tension Washers.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3333">NOTE -- Imitation or bent Needles will cause 
  loose stitches and breaking of thread</font>.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3333">&quot;Tension does not work&quot;<font color="#000000"> 
  -- A knot on thread may have broken off in AUTOMATIC TENSION. Raise Needle Bar 
  to <i><font color="#CC3333">highest point</font></i>, and draw a piece of folded 
  writing paper between Washers, both front and back of Tension.</font></font></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">Accident to Machine</font></h3>
<p align="center">In case of accident, unscrew Machine from Table, pack tightly 
  in a small box, so that it will not be shaken about in transit, and send by 
  Express to us, or any of our Branches for repair. <i><font color="#CC3333">First 
  tie a tag or card with your name and full address to the Machine before sealing 
  up the box</font></i><font color="#000000">, and give the office to which you 
  send it full particulars, stating also number of Machine. <i><font color="#CC3333">Do 
  not send the Thumb Screw or Attachments.</font></i></font></p>
