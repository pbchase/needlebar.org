<h3 align="center"><font color="#663300">Setting the Needle</font></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#663300"><font color="#000000">This operation so 
  important, and in other Machines so difficult, is rendered easy and certain 
  by the patented improvement, applied to the Automatic Sewing Machine.</font></font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig56.gif" width="403" height="272"></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Let <font color="#CC3333">Presser Foot</font> 
  down on <font color="#CC3333">Cloth Plate</font> by turning <font color="#CC3333">Lifter</font> 
  to right or left; raise <font color="#CC3333">Needle Bar</font> to its <i><font color="#CC3333">highest</font></i> 
  point by turning <font color="#CC3333">Small Wheel</font>; then holding Needle 
  between thumb and finger (Fig 5), and with groove toward the left, let its point 
  go down into the &quot;Needle Hole&quot; in Plate until you are able to bring 
  shank of Needle directly under the end of <font color="#CC3333">Needle Bar</font>. 
  If it does not readily enter, roll it between thumb and finger while pressing 
  it up, and it will soon find its proper <img src="fig7.gif" width="239" height="299" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">position 
  and enter easily. Then push Needle up as far as you can with the fingers; then 
  apply slot in wrench (Fig 6) below the taper on the Needle, and push it up as 
  high as it will go. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Before taking Wrench off, hold Needle 
  again firmly between the thumb and finger, to prevent it slipping down; then 
  place Wrench on Nut (Fig 7), and turn it to <font color="#CC3333">right</font> 
  until Needle is held firmly in its place.</font></p>
<p align="center"><i><font color="#CC3333">Keep the Needle sharp</font><font color="#000000">.</font></i><font color="#000000"> 
  A dull Needle cannot do good work, and is liable to become bent in going through 
  the cloth.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#663300">To Take Out the Needle</font></h3>
<p align="center">Let <font color="#CC3333">Presser Foot</font> down, and raise 
  <font color="#CC3333">Needle Bar</font> to its <i><font color="#CC3333">highest 
  point</font>. </i>Unscrew <font color="#CC3333">Needle Bar Nut</font> with <font color="#CC3333">Needle 
  Wrench</font>, taking a half turn to the left.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#663300">To Tighten the Belt</font></h3>
<p align="center">Should Belt become loose after use, and you wish to tighten 
  it, unscrew one end of Belt from Brass Ferrule, and shorten it by cutting off 
  from one-quarter to one-half inch; then place end of Belt on bare floor, or 
  on any smooth hard surface where you can gently roll it under your foot, so 
  as to compress the end which enters ferrule, and screw together as below.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#663300">To Apply the Belt</font></h3>
<p align="center">Pass one end between the Pitman and Large Wheel, then pass both 
  ends up through slot in Table. Hold end of Belt (having the ferrule) in left 
  hand; take the other end of Belt between the thumb and finger of right hand, 
  and turn it <i><font color="#CC3333">towards you six full turns</font></i> -- 
  this will put a twist, or &quot;kink&quot; in Belt. Then push end of Belt hard 
  into ferrule, screwing it in as far as you can by <i><font color="#CC3333">turning 
  it from you</font></i> which will take the twist out of Belt and leave it straight.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#663300">To Thread the Machine</font></h3>
<p align="center">Machines are always sent from our offices properly threaded; 
  therefore, observe Machine carefully when you receive it. The direction of thread 
  is shown by the darts in Fig 9.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig9.gif" width="419" height="381"></p>
<p align="center">When threading, first pull out <font color="#CC3333">Spool Pin</font>, 
  and place spool upon it, noticing that spool revolves freely around Pin. Replace 
  <font color="#CC3333">Spool Pin</font>. Raise <font color="#CC3333">Needle Bar</font> 
  to <i><font color="#CC3333">highest point</font></i> by turning <font color="#CC3333">Small 
  Wheel</font>, and then proceed as follows:</p>
<p align="left">1. Thread from back toward you, through the two staples and hole 
  in Arm known as <font color="#CC3333">Pull-off</font> (1, Fig 9).</p>
<p align="left">2. Then carry thread between spool and <font color="#CC3333">Automatic 
  Tension</font>, being careful to draw thread between the washers under cap of 
  <font color="#CC3333">Automatic Tension</font> (2, Fig 9)</p>
<p align="left">3. Thread from right to left through <font color="#CC3333">Thread 
  Pin</font> on top of Frame (3, Fig 9).</p>
<p align="left">*4. From right to left through <font color="#CC3333">Wire Staple</font> 
  (4, Fig 9). * NOTE Do not thread through loop of Spring under the staple, unless 
  embroidering. </p>
<p align="left">5. Take thread between thumb and finger of both hands, passing 
  it between <font color="#CC3333">Needle Bar</font> and <font color="#CC3333">Take-up</font>, 
  and press it from you into opening at top of <font color="#CC3333">Take-up</font> 
  (5, Fig 9).</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">To Regulate Length of Stitch to Size 
  of Thread or Silk Used</font></h3>
<p align="center"><img src="fig10.gif" width="361" height="375" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="right">From 
  Fig 10 it will be seen that there is stamped upon Cloth Plate of the Machine 
  a &quot;Table&quot; showing proper size of Needle and length of stitch for each 
  size of cotton or silk. For example: For 80 thread or 0 silk, use a No. 2 Needle, 
  and 22 stitches to an inch.</p>
<p align="center">To left of this &quot;Table&quot; is a slot, surrounded by a 
  shield inscribed &quot;Stitches to an inch&quot;. To obtain length of stitch 
  required, move handle of <font color="#CC3333">Stitch Regulator</font> until 
  proper number appears through slot. <i>The length of stitch indicated by the 
  &quot;Table&quot; should always be used</i>, as the proper elasticity will then 
  be secured in all seams. A strict adherence to the &quot;Table&quot; will always 
  ensure good and durable work.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">Selecting Thread or Silk</font></h3>
<p align="center">When selecting thread or silk for machine sewing, the operator 
  should bear in mind that generally <i><font color="#CC3333">three or four sizes 
  finer than that used in hand sewing is strong enough</font></i>, and best adapted 
  to the work. For instance, where 60 cotton would be used in hand sewing, use 
  80 cotton on the Machine. By using 80 or 90 cotton on muslin you will have a 
  seam as strong as the fabric, and a chain so small on underside of garment as 
  to make it almost impossible to detect it after laundering. This rule also applies 
  to finer materials.</p>
<p align="center">The following rules on this subject will be found useful:</p>
<p align="left">For bleached muslin, shirting etc., use ----------- From 80 to 
  100 white cotton</p>
<p align="left">Dress Making ---------------------------------- From 70 to 100 
  black cotton, 70 only in colors, 0 or A silk</p>
<p align="left">For tucking cotton or silk ----------------------- From 100 to 
  200 cotton, 000, 00 silk</p>
<p align="left">For light woollen clothing, flannels etc. ---------- 70 to 90</p>
<p align="left">For heavy woollen clothing --------------------- 60 to 80</p>
<p align="left">For fine linens ---------------------------------- 100 to 150</p>
<p align="left">For fine lawns, nainsooks etc. ------------------ 120 to 200</p>
<p align="left">For embroidering * ---------------------------- E or F silk (* 
  When threading for embroidery, thread through Embroidery Spring. See &quot;Embroidering&quot;)</p>
<p align="left">For hemming silk or wool goods --------------- 000 silk</p>
<p align="left">For braiding ----------------------------------- 80 cotton or 
  0 silk</p>
<p align="center">We recommend the use of Willcox &amp; Gibbs Cotton, and while 
  any good cotton can be used, Willcox &amp; Gibbs Cotton invariably gives the 
  best results.</p>
<p align="center">When colored cottons are required, use Willcox &amp; Gibbs colored 
  Cotton, and in the case of black select one number coarser than called for in 
  the above rules. Colored cotton can be had only in number 80.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">Size Needle to be Used</font></h3>
<p align="center">The &quot;Table&quot; stamped upon <font color="#CC3333">Cloth 
  Plate</font> (Fig 10) shows by number the proper size of needle to be used with 
  each size of thread or silk.</p>
<p align="center">The number is stamped on shank of each Needle.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="needle1.gif" width="336" height="89"></p>
<p align="center">CAUTION: -- Every Needle made by us is stamped on shank <img src="needle2.gif" width="123" height="41" align="absmiddle"> 
  and <img src="needle3.gif" width="201" height="22" align="absmiddle"></p>
<p align="center">All others are worthless imitations and invariably <i><font color="#CC3333">give 
  trouble</font> </i> as well as <i><font color="#CC3333">injure the Machine</font>. 
  </i>Imitations or bent needles will cause loose stitches and breaking of thread.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">The Automatic Tension</font></h3>
<p align="center">This important feature of the <font color="#CC3333">Willcox 
  &amp; Gibbs Automatic Sewing Machine</font> calls for few words of explanation, 
  as it is entirely self-acting, requiring no attention or skill on the part of 
  the operator, no matter what nature the fabric my be, or what size of thread 
  or silk is required.</p>
<p align="center">No adjustment of he Automatic Tension being required for any 
  size thread or silk, or any kind or thickness of work, it only remains for operator 
  to select thread or silk, and to regulate the stitch, by following the directions 
  on page 13 and the &quot;Table&quot; stamped on <font color="#CC3333">Cloth 
  Plate</font> (Fig 10). The operator can then be certain that Machine will start 
  immediately and do perfect work.</p>
<p align="center">The <font color="#CC3333">Automatic Tension</font> is not at 
  all liable to get out of order, but will remain perfectly adjusted and self-adjusting, 
  if not meddled with.</p>
<p align="center"><i><font color="#CC3333">We repeat the caution: - </font></i><font color="#CC3333">Do 
  not Oil the Automatic Tension </font></p>
