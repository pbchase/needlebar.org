<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO REGULATE THE LENGTH OF THE STITCH</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Near the right hand end of the bed plate 
  of the machine will be found the stitch thumb screw No. 99 1/2, as shown above. 
  To lengthen the stitch, turn the thumb screw to the right, thus,</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"> <font color="#CC0000"><img src="cw.jpg" width="61" height="62">. 
  </font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><font color="#CC0000"><font color="#000000">To 
  shorten the stitch, turn to the left, thus, </font></font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><font color="#CC0000"><font color="#000000"><img src="ccw.jpg" width="63" height="62"></font>

<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">Fig. 16</font></b></h3>
<h3 align="center"><img src="fig15-16.jpg" width="689" height="793"></h3>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO REMOVE THE NEEDLE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Raise the needle bar to its highest point, 
  lift the presser foot and turn it back out of the way, loosen the screw No. 
  41, and remove the needle.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO SET THE NEEDLE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Hold the needle between the thumb and 
  the index finger of the left hand, and pass the point down through the needle 
  hole in the throat plate; then enter the shank of the needle in the hole in 
  the lower end of the needle bar, and push the needle up until the lower part 
  of the shank at S (Fig. 15, page 16) is even with the lower end of the needle 
  bar, and fasten it in its place with the screw No. 41.</font></p>
<p align="center"><i><font color="#000000">Be very careful</font></i><font color="#000000"> 
  to have the short groove of the needle next to the shuttle; remove both slides 
  Nos. 112 and 113 (see Fig. 14, page 15); thread the needle from left to right, 
  so that the thread will run across the centre of the throat plate, as shown 
  in Figs. 10 and 14, pages 12 and 15; turn the driving-wheel from you until the 
  needle descends to its lowest point.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">By continuing this movement the needle 
  will raise about one-eighth of an inch, at the same time throwing out a loop 
  of thread squarely into the shuttle race, through which the shuttle will pass.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">If your needle is set right, the bottom 
  of this loop and the eye of the needle will be even with the bottom of the shuttle 
  race, as shown in Fig. 16, page 16. For fine thread, the needle may be set a 
  trifle higher, until the point of the shuttle enters the largest part of the 
  loop. </font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">MISSING STITCHES</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">If the needle is improperly set it may 
  throw the loop to one side, so that the shuttle will pass by instead of through 
  the loop. To prevent this, turn the needle in opposite direction until it throws 
  the loop full into the shuttle race. Sometimes the machine will miss stitches 
  because the needle sets too far from the shuttle, and at other times the shuttle 
  will strike the needle because the needle sets into the shuttle race.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To adjust the needle nearer to or further 
  from the shuttle, place the wrench 198 (Fig. 16, page 16) on the head of the 
  screw No. 28, and press it downwards; this will loosen the screw, so that the 
  head of the machine can be moved.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To adjust the needle nearer to the shuttle, 
  move the end of the adjusting cam (27) up and then turn the screw (28) back 
  into its place.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To adjust the needle farther from the 
  shuttle, move the adjusting cam (27) downwards and tighten the screw, as before. 
  The needle should set as near the shuttle as possible without striking it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">NOTE -- The adjustment referred to above 
  is only necessary in changing from fine to coarse needles.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO REGULATE THE TENSIONS</font></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Before commencing to sew, always be careful 
  to have some tension upon each thread. Try them with the hand to see that they 
  pull as nearly alike as possible.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">If the threads are of the proper size, 
  having the right and equal amount of tension upon them, they will be drawn and 
  locked together in the centre of the material, thus <font color="#FF0000"> <img src="thread1.gif" width="201" height="50" align="absmiddle"><font color="#000000">If 
  the shuttle tension is tight and the upper tension too loose, the under thread 
  will lie straight, thus, <img src="thread2.gif" width="195" height="54" align="absmiddle">. 
  On the contrary, if the upper tension is tight and the lower tension too loose, 
  the upper thread will lie straight, thus, <img src="thread3.gif" width="188" height="52" align="absmiddle">. 
  Therefore, in order to make a perfect stitch on both sides of the material, 
  it is necessary to have the tensions as nearly equal as possible, and tight 
  enough <i>only</i> to make a firm seam without breaking the threads.</font></font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To tighten the tension on the upper thread, 
  turn the tension thumb nut 128 to the right, thus,</font><img src="cw.jpg" width="61" height="62" align="absmiddle"></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To loosen it, turn to the left, thus,</font><img src="ccw.jpg" width="63" height="62" align="absmiddle"></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To tighten the lower or shuttle tension, 
  turn the small screw No. 70, near the point of the shuttle, </font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">to the left, thus,<img src="ccw.jpg" width="63" height="62" align="absmiddle"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To loosen, turn it to the right, thus,<img src="cw.jpg" width="61" height="62" align="absmiddle"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">In changing the shuttle tension, which 
  is seldom necessary, turn the screw but very little.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">NOTE -- Remember the shuttle tension screw 
  No. 70 is a left hand screw, and operates the reverse of ordinary screws.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">NOTE -- In sewing heavy garments, they 
  must be held so as not to pull back on the feed, or the stitches will be irregular.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">When the machine is in operation, do not 
  pull upon the goods so as to bend or break the needle.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">Fig. 17</font></b></h3>
<h3 align="center"><img src="fig17.jpg" width="617" height="767"></h3>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">COMMENCING TO SEW</font></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The machine being fully threaded, both 
  above and below, the shuttle thread drawnup through the throat plate 109, the 
  needle bar and presser foot both at their highest point, slacken the thread, 
  as shown at A, Fig. 18, page 20, and draw it through the eye of the needle, 
  so as to leave an end about two or three inches long. Draw the shuttle thread 
  up through the throat plate about the same distance, pass the two ends BB under 
  the presser foot towards the back part of the machine, as shown in Fig. 18.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Attach the gauge No. 201 to the bed plate 
  of the machine by means of the screw under the needle far enough to the right 
  to make a seam of the proper width.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Let down the presser foot upon the work, 
  move up the gauge to the edge of the goods, and fasten it there with the thumb 
  screw No. 202; start the machine, holding the ends of the threads down until 
  two or three stitches have been taken; then remove the hand from the threads 
  and proceed with the sewing, the goods being kept even with their edges against 
  teh gauge. If the tensions are right, the stitch will be alike on both sides 
  of the material.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">Fig. 18</font></b></h3>
<h3 align="center"><img src="fig18.jpg" width="633" height="763"></h3>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO REMOVE THE WORK FROM THE MACHINE</font></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">On reaching the end of the seam, stop 
  the machine, with the needle at its highest point.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Take hold of the thread at A and slacken 
  it, by drawing about two inches off from the spool, raise the presser foot, 
  take hold of the work, raise it up and draw it gently from you towards the back 
  of the machine, keeping the upper thread in the notch in the presser foot to 
  avoid bending the needle, as shown above. Cut the threads about two inches from 
  the needle.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">NOTE -- If the shuttle thread should break 
  in taking the work out, it will be an indication that the shuttle tension is 
  <i>too tight</i>, and should be loosened a little.</font></p>
