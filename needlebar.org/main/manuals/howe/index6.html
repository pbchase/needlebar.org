<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">ATTACHMENTS &amp;c.,</font></b></h3>
<h4 align="center"><font color="#CC0000"><b>ADAPTED TO THE HOWE SEWING MACHINE</b></font></h4>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">----------------------------------</font></b></h3>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">BED PLATE HEMMER</font></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">We have several sizes which are used chiefly 
  for sheeting, table cloths, and material generally of this description. In ordering 
  there hemmers, the size of them should be mentioned.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">We also make an adjustable hemmer, which 
  can be adjusted to make hems of any size up to an inch.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">INSTRUCTION -- Leave the ordinary presser 
  foot on the machine, raising it from the feed. Attach the hemmer to the bed 
  of the machines by means of the gauge screw No. 202 (some of the larger sizes 
  are fastened with two screws). Enter the edge of the material in the hemmer 
  so as to fill the scroll; work it forward and back a little until the hem is 
  turned evenly; let the presser foot down, being careful not to disarrange the 
  hem; start the machine, and guide the material so as to keep the scroll filled.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">These hemmers are charged extra.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">BINDERS</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">We have several kinds, adapted for different 
  descriptions of work, such as dressmaking, tailoring, hat binding, &amp;c. In 
  ordering, the purpose for which it is required should be stated.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Binders are charged extra, and instructions 
  sent, if required.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">CORDER</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">This is a special attachment, and is charged 
  extra. We give instructions fot the description of corder most generally used.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">INSTRUCTIONS -- Fold the material and 
  crease it down, pass one edge of the material under and the other over the corder 
  blade, so that the end of the corder blade will be between the cloth and close 
  against the crease, and let down the foot upon the work. In stitching in the 
  forst cord, guide the work slightly to the left, so as to lay the cord close 
  into the crease, keeping the work smoothly in front of the needle, the cord 
  passing through the left hand groove in the bottom of the corder foot. Stitch 
  the second cord in close against the first by guiding the work slightly to the 
  left, as before.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Make the stitch rather longer than in 
  ordinary sewing, and in turning square corners have the needle down.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">This attachment will be charged for extra.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">RUFFLER</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">We now give this attachment with each 
  step-feed machine.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">INSTRUCTIONS -- Place the pin through 
  the hole in the presser foot, and secure it by the screw No. 107. The material 
  to be gathered or ruffled is then put under the ruffler, so as to rest on the 
  feed. The band, if one is to be sewn on at the same time, must be placed between 
  the opening in the ruffler, and should be held a little tightly with the hand, 
  It is necessary to lengthen the stitch and loosen the tension.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">NOTE -- The following accessories, viz.: 
  A gauge, thumb-screw, twelve needles, six bobbins, one wrench, oil-can, screw-driver, 
  shuttle screw-driver, an extra needle or throat-plate, a narrow hemmer (which 
  is also a feller), a braider and quilting gauge, go ith each family machine 
  -- also with the step feed B and step feed C machines -- free of charge.</font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#000000">--------------------------------------</font></b></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">HALF CASES</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The Half Case is useful for preserving 
  the machine from dust, and for preventing its improper use; at the same time 
  it forms a handsome piece of furniture. Price 20s.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">BOXES FOR HAND MACHINE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">For preserving the machine, and for facility 
  in transport.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Plain, 5s.; Polished, 10s.; Black Walnut, 
  15s. </font></p>
<h2 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">THE HOWE HAND MACHINE</font></b></h2>
<h2 align="center"><img src="fig25.jpg" width="578" height="421"></h2>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">This illustration shows the Howe Hand 
  Machine, with all the latest improvements. The machine as above can be placed 
  on a stand, and the belt can either be put in the groove on the large hand wheel, 
  which gives a very easy motion; or the belt may be put on the small pulley on 
  the shaft, which gives greater speed -- an essential in very light work -- but 
  not quite the same power.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">If the purchaser requires the machine 
  to work by treadle only, and not by hand, a hole can be cut in the table top, 
  and the machine placed therein, the same as the A and B machines.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The construction of the machine is so 
  perfect that it will do what may be considered light, and also heavy work fr 
  a hand machine, but we do not recommend this machine to be kept constantly on 
  very heavy work.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To prevent the liability, when moving 
  the machine, of having the head drop from the base, we sometimes put a screw 
  into the bed-hinge stud (239) with a washer, which perfectly secures the bed 
  of the machine to the base. This is not actually essential, but is found serviceable 
  when perfect security is required against the possibility of accident.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Nearly all the parts of the Howe Hand 
  Machine are similar to those of the A and B machines. Some are smaller, but 
  the same in principle and action; therefore in giving instructions we only touch 
  on those points which are on this machine and not on the others.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig26.jpg" width="558" height="465"></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO WIND THE BOBBIN</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Pull out the nut on the side of the wheel, 
  turn it hal way, so as to free the pin from the large geared wheel, thus allowing 
  the hand wheel to revolve without turning the machine; then lift the winder, 
  so that it will press against the wheel; and place the bobbin according to the 
  instructions given in page 9. When finished pull the winder to the right, and 
  it will fall and rest upon the bed plate. Replace the nut, so that the hand 
  wheel is connected with the geared wheel, and the machine is ready to work.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The Shuttle Lever (78) is different in 
  form at the end from the lever of the A, B and C. The two holes in the end are 
  made oblong, so that the shuttle-carrier can be adjusted either nearer to or 
  farther from the shuttle race, as may be found necessary.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">In putting the shuttle into the machine, 
  care should be taken not to destroy the spring (277) at the back of the shuttle-carrier, 
  which is put there for the purpose of pressing the shuttle against the face 
  of the race; should the spring become broken, the shuttle would be liable not 
  to catch the loop of the thread, and therefore not pass through.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO OIL THE MACHINE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Press the spring of the latch to the right, 
  and turn the machine over on its hinges. Oil all the bearings, and follow instructions 
  given in page 7.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">ATTACHMENTS AND ACCESSORIES</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">All attachments and accessories which 
  can be used upon our Family Machines for braidning, hemming, felling, &amp;c., 
  may be applied to this machine.</font></p>
<h2 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE WHEEL-FEED MACHINE</font></b></h2>
<h2 align="center"><img src="fig27.jpg" width="645" height="693"></h2>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Instead of the above top tension (No.116), 
  the old style flat tension, which is adjusted by a set screw, can be supplied 
  if desired.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#663300">TO LENGTHEN OR SHORTEN THE STITCH 
  OF THE WHEEL-FEED MACHINE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">On the end of the shaft of the machine 
  is a conical cam (182), against which the feed rider (175) rests. Connected 
  with this cam is a thumb nut (184). By turning this nut so that the cam (182) 
  will be moved on to the shaft, the stitch will be lengthened; and by reversing 
  this nut so that the cam is moved towards the end of the shaft, the stitch will 
  be shortened.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">On the &quot;C&quot; machine the conical 
  feed cam (No.182) is much larger than on the &quot;B&quot;, which enables the 
  operator to make a much longer stitch; but if specially ordered this larger 
  cam could be adjusted to the &quot;B&quot; machine, where work with a very long 
  stitch is required.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO RAISE OR LOWER THE FEED</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><i><font color="#000000">To Raise the Feed </font></i><font color="#000000">-- 
  loosen the nut (165), on the feed-wheel stud (163), and press the feed-wheel 
  (162) upwards, and tighten the nut again firmly in its place. For ordinary dewing, 
  the teeth of the feed-wheel should rise about 1/32 of an inch above the top 
  of the needle plate. When using the machine for leather binding, or on thick 
  wadded fabrics, the teeth should come up about 1/20 of an inch above the needle 
  plate.</font></p>
<p align="center"><i><font color="#000000">To Lower the Feed </font></i><font color="#000000">-- 
  loosen the nut as before, and the feed-wheel will drop downwards as far as you 
  wish. When it is in proper position, tighten the nut as before.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The feed-clutches (172) should be kept 
  well oiled to prevent wear, and also to make them work evenly and securely.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Care should be taken that the feed-rider 
  (175) works freely in the feed-clutch lever (169), so as not to cut the feed-cam 
  (182).</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The feed-brake (177) should at all times 
  rest firmly on the feed-wheel.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">THE ROLL PRESSER</font></b></h3>
<h2 align="center"><img src="fig28.jpg" width="281" height="294"></h2>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Take the flat presser foot off and fasten 
  the roll presser (218) to the presser bar; let the edge of the roll presser 
  be close to the needle hole, and fasten it securely to the presser bar by screws 
  (223).</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">This attachment is given with every wheel-feed 
  machine, and is used in place of the flat presser when stitching heavy material.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">THE FOLLOWING ACCESSORIES ARE SENT 
  WITH EACH WHEEL-FEED MACHINE:</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Roll Presser, Flat Presser, Tucking Guide 
  and Screw, Six Bobbins, Twelve Needles, Two Screw Drivers, Wrench, Oil Can, 
  and ectra Throat Plate.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">All the parts of the wheel-feed machines 
  are the same as those of the step-feed machines, except the parts as numbered 
  and named in the plate of parts section K.</font></p>
