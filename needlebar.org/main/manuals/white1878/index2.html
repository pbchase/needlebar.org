  <h4><b><font color="#660000">TO FILL THE BOBBINS WITH THREAD</font></b></h4>
  <h5><b><font color="#CC3333">NEVER USE GLAZED THREAD ON THE BOBBIN</font></b></h5>
  <p>27 represents the Bobbin Winder which is fastened firmly to the arm of the 
    machine. Place the spool of thread on spool standard 2, and fasten the end 
    of the thread between the end of the bobbin and the bobbin winder shaft, and 
    put the other end of the bobbin in the bobbin winder which will press the 
    friction wheel 28 against the flywheel of the machine; then turn clutch 74 
    off from pin on fly-wheel, and proceed to work the machine as in sewing, and 
    guide the thread evenly with the left hand until the bobbin id nearly or quite 
    full. By this device the operator can wind bobbins without running the entire 
    machine, or without removing the attachments, or disturbing the garment sewed.</p>

  <h3><b><font color="#660000">TO THREAD THE SHUTTLE</font></b></h3>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">THE SHUTTLE</font></b></h4>
  <h5><b>OF THE</b></h5>
  <p><b><font color="#660000">WHITE SEWING MACHINE</font></b><b> IS </b></p>
  <h5><b>ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE</b></h5>
  <h5><b>THE LEAST COMPLICATED</b></h5>
  <h5><b>OF ANY IN THE MARKET.</b></h5>
  <p>Having raised the latch 45 holding the bobbin so that the thread will draw 
    off the under side place one end of the bobbin into the center of the heel 
    of the Shuttle, and drop the other end into the slotted hole 48 in point of 
    the shuttle; then pass the thread through the hole 46 then back through the 
    hole 47; then out through the hole 47 1/2; then through the hole 44 in the 
    latch; thence pass the thread outward, <i>under</i> the outside spring, as 
    shown. In all cases the thread must pass out <i>under</i> the outside spring.</p>
  <p>WE HAVE NO SPIRAL SPRINGS ABOUT OUR SHUTTLE. IT IS SIMPLE, DURABLE AND EFFECTIVE. 
    THERE IS ONLY ONE HOLE TO THREAD THROUGH, AS THE OTHER HOLES ARE ALL SLOTTED.</p>
  <p>To open the latch, press slightly against it, and open.</p>
  <p><b><i>---------------------------------------</i></b></p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">TO REMOVE THE SHUTTLE</font></b></h4>
  <p>Open the front shuttle slide to take the Shuttle from the machine. Do not 
    undertake to turn the machine back for oiling with the rear shuttle slide 
    partly pulled out.</p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">TO CONTROL THE TENSIONS</font></b></h4>
  <p>When the stitching shows the under thread drawn through on top of the fabric, 
    the tension on the shuttle thread is too loose, or the tension on the upper 
    thread is too tight; if it shows the upper thread drawn down on the under 
    side of the fabric, it indicates that the tension is too tight on the shutle 
    thread or too loose on the upper thread.</p>
  <p>4 represents the tension nut. By turning it to the right you tighten the 
    tension on the upper thread; and by turning it to the left you loosen the 
    tension on the upper thread.</p>
  <p>50 represents the tension screw in the shuttle. To increase the tension turn 
    the screw to the right with the shuttle screw driver; to decrease the tension, 
    turn the screw to the left.</p>
  <p>WE CLAIM A DECIDED ADVANTAGE IN THE CONTROL OF OUR SHUTTLE TENSION, AS IT 
    IS SO ARRANGED THAT WE CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE IT WITHOUT REMOVING THE SHUTTLE 
    FROM THE MACHINE, OR DISARRANGING THE WORK.</p>
  <p><b><i>-----------------------------------</i></b></p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">TO CHANGE THE LENGTH OF STITCH</font></b></h4>
  <p>12 represents the Feed Screw. By turning it to the right you shorten the 
    stitch; by turning it to the left you lengthen the stitch.</p>
  <p><b><i>------------------------------------</i></b></p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">TO THREAD THE MACHINE</font></b></h4>
  <p>Place the spool of thread on the spool standard 2, pass the thread under 
    the tension check spring at 3, then once around the tension wheel, then through 
    thread guide 51 on top of the face plate then through the eyelets respectively 
    at the top and bottom of take up 52, then through threaded guide 53, and thence 
    through the eye of the needle.</p>
  <p><b><i>-------------------------------------</i></b></p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">TO COMMENCE WORK</font></b></h4>
  <p>In threading the needle and shuttle respectively, you should leave an end 
    of thread about two inches in length to each. Hold the end of the upper thread 
    loosely in the left hand, and with the right hand gently revolve the fly wheel 
    until the needle passes to its lowest point and returns, when if it is set 
    properly a loop will be formed through which the shuttle will pass, and as 
    the needle ascends it wil draw up the lower or shuttle thread. Now see that 
    the shuttle slides are both closed over the shuttle, and the machine is ready 
    for practical operation.</p>
  <p><b><i>------------------------------------</i></b></p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">TO REMOVE THE WORK</font></b></h4>
  <p>Stop the machine with the needle at its highest point; raise the presser 
    foot; slacken the upper thread by drawing about three inches from the top 
    spool, then take hold of your work and pull it directly from, keeping the 
    top thread in the slot of the presser foot which will prevent bending the 
    needle. Cut the threads close to the cloth which will leave the ends projecting 
    from needle and shuttle, preparatory to commencing work again.</p>
  <p><b><i>---------------------------------------</i></b></p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">KEEP THE MACHINE WELL CLEANED AND OILED</font></b></h4>
  <p>If the machine is dirty or <i>gummed </i>up with poor oil, clean it off by 
    the use of spirits of turpentine or kerosene; then wipe dry and apply fine 
    sperm oil, as follows: The figure 54 represents five oil holes on the upper 
    part of the machine through which you can insert the nozzle of the oil can 
    and oil. KEEP THE INSIDE WORKING PARTS OF THE MACHINE THOROUGHLY OILED. In 
    addition to the oil holes the upper part of the machine should be thoroughly 
    oiled on the needle bar; also the roller and pivot on which the take up 52 
    works. The bearings of the bobbin winder, in which the spindle and shaft revolve 
    should be kept constantly oiled. To oil the under side, slip the belt off 
    the balance wheel and turn the machine back on its hinges and oil all the 
    places indicated by the numbers 13 - 17 - 19 - 20 - 21 - 23 - 24 - 25 - 26 
    - 37. Use only the best quality of sperm oil, and then after standing a few 
    moments take a cloth slightly moistened with oil and clean off the superfluous 
    oil from the japanned parts of the machine, also from the needle bar and the 
    race in which the shuttle vibrates.</p>
  <h3><b><font color="#660000">The Iron Stand</font></b></h3>
  <p><font color="#000000">Oil should be distributed frequently upon the treadle 
    rod cones at 60; upon the balance wheel cones at 63; and upon the pitman connections 
    at 62 - 66.</font></p>
  <p><b><i><font color="#000000">----------------------------------------</font></i></b></p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">THREAD</font></b></h4>
  <p>Do not use poor thread. You must not expect to make a nice smooth stitch 
    with cheap, uneven thread. Clark's six cord spool cotton is the best, and 
    we will fill all orders for it promptly, by mail or express, on receipt of 
    price, viz: 65 cents per dozen spools.</p>
  <p><b><i>------------------------------------------</i></b></p>
  <h4><font color="#660000">EXPLANATION OF DIFFICULTIES THAT SOMETIMES OCCUR WITH 
    BEGINNERS</font></h4>
  <p><i>If the upper thread breaks </i>it may be caused by the needle not being 
    properly set, or the machine not threaded correctly, or the upper tension 
    too tight, or the thread uneven and the needle too small for it, or the needle 
    eye too sharp, or the presser foot attached to the machine so that the needle 
    rubs it in passing.</p>
  <p><i>If the under thread breaks </i>it may be caused by the shuttle being improperly 
    threaded, or too much tension upon it, or by the bobbin being wound too full 
    so that the thread slips over the ends of the bobbin in the shuttle, or by 
    the thread being caught in the shuttle slides.</p>
  <p><i>If the needle breaks </i>it is more than likely your own fault, caused 
    by pulling the goods to or from you in such a manner that the needle strikes 
    the throat plate and is bound to break. The needle may, however, break in 
    trying to sew extraordinary heavy seams when the pressure on the presser foot 
    is not heavy enough.</p>
  <p>To create more pressure upon the goods, turn the pressure bar nut 5 to the 
    right; to decrease the pressure turn it to the left.</p>
  <p><i>If the machine skips stitches </i>the needle may not be aligned correctly 
    if the long groove is not exactly to the left.</p>
  <p><i>If the stitches are not even </i>it may be caused by the presser foot 
    not resting evenly upon the fabric sewed, or by the feed not being high enough, 
    or by the stitch being too short, or by pulling the cloth, or by using too 
    fine a needle with two coarse or uneven thread.</p>
  <h3><font color="#660000">Notice</font></h3>
  <p>The leather band should always be tight enough not to slip. If it slips or 
    does not force the needle through thick goods, cut off a very short piece 
    and readjust the ends. The belt should not be so tight as to prevent an easy 
    motion of the machine.</p>
  <p><b><i>-----------------------------------------</i></b></p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">FREE WITH EACH MACHINE</font></b></h4>
  <p>One hemmer which is also the feller, one braider, one quilter, one pair castors 
    (attached to the right hand leg), one bottle of oli, one oil can, one oil 
    can holder (attached to the underside of the table), one screw driver, one 
    gauge and screw, one shuttle in the machine, six bobbins, six needles, one 
    shuttle tension screw driver and one spool of thread on machine, ready for 
    use, and one copy of directions.</p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">DIRECTIONS FOR USING THE ATTACHMENTS</font></b></h4>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">Hemming</font></b></h4>
  <p>Raise the needle to its highest point, remove the presser foot and in its 
    place attach the hemmer. Insert the edge of the cloth, folded up, into the 
    mouth of the hemmer and with a pin or thread in the fold draw the edge of 
    the cloth far enough through the hemmer so that the needle will enter the 
    cloth at its extreme edge; then proceed to sew, keeping the edge turned as 
    it feeds through.</p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">Felling</font></b></h4>
  <p>The hemmer is also a feller. Sew together two pieces of cloth with the under 
    edge projecting between an eighth and quarter of an inch beyond the upper 
    edge, then trim the edges if necessary, and open the work flat, wrong side 
    up, and fold down the wider edge toward the left over the narrow edge, and 
    then pass the folded edge into the feller the sam as ordinary hemming.</p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">Wide Hemming</font></b></h4>
  <p>Any width hem can be made with the hemmer and feller upon light fabrics, 
    by simply folding the goods the desired width of hem and then passing the 
    edge through, as in narrow hemming. To successfully do various widths of hemming 
    upon all classes of goods, we recommend the sets of hemmers of which there 
    are five sizes. The complete set is sold for $1.00, and is extra.</p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">Cording</font></b></h4>
  <p>The corder is fastened to the presser bar the same as the presser foot. Pass 
    the cord through the tube on the edge of the corder and carry the end of the 
    cord from you about three inches; fold the fabric you desire to cord and place 
    one sid eof the fold under the tube and the other over it; draw the cloth 
    to the left so that the folded edge is close against the <i>cord tube </i>; 
    then let down the corder and proceed to sew.</p>
  <p>If the needle stitches too far from the cord or too close simply loosen the 
    screw and swing the corder to the right or left, as required.</p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">Braiding</font></b></h4>
  <p>The braider is attached the same as the corder. Insert the braid down through 
    the hole in the braider, under the bar, and carry the braid far enough back 
    of the needle for the feed to take hold of it, then let it down on the fabric 
    and proceed the same as in plain sewing.</p>
  <p>ITEM -- When you turn a corner in braiding, after the braider presser foot 
    has been let down, draw the braid back so that there will be no slack between 
    the braider and the braid.</p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">Binding</font></b></h4>
  <p>The adjustable binder attached to the machine with the gauge screw and can 
    be adjusted for any width of binding. Put the binding through both hooks of 
    the binder and draw it over the feed, then place the cloth to be bound between 
    the two hooks, close against the binding and let down the presser foot, and 
    proceed to sew as in ordinary sewing.</p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">Quilting</font></b></h4>
  <p>The quilter is attached to the presser bar by being passed through it in 
    the hole just above the presser foot; move the quilter further from the needle 
    for a wide space between rows, or close to the needle for a narrow space.</p>
  <h4><b><font color="#660000">Tucking, Gathering and Embroidering</font></b></h4>
  <p>These are attachments that we do not make, but keep for sale at manufacturers' 
    price, and each is acompanied with the necessary directions for use.</p>
