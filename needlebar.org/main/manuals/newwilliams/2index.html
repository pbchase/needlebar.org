  before inserting the bobbin on top of the arm of the machine, draw off a few 
  inches of thread, pass the end of it through the small hole in the brass head 
  of bobbin from the inside. With the left hand pull the spindle to the left and 
  insert the bobbin, with the end that you have the thread inserted in to the 
  left, taking care that the little pin in the driving head enters the hole in 
  the end of the bobbin, pass the thread into the notch in top of the arm of winder, 
  downward and into the notch at the bottom of the arm, then round the back of 
  the tension screw and start slowly to wind the bobbin, holding the free end 
  of the thread for a few revolutions, so as to get the winding properly started. 
  There should be no slack thread left between the spool and the bobbin when you 
  are ready to wind.</p>

<p align="center">Take hold of the BALANCE WHEEL, with one hand and the Needle-thread 
  with the other. Let the thread lie slack, so as not to spring the Needle. Move 
  the Wheel from you once round, and pull up the slack of the needle-thread with 
  your hand, in order to draw the Shuttle-thread up through the needle-plate; 
  then take both threads and pass them under the PRESSER-FOOT, towards the back 
  of the Machine. Then close the slide over the SHUTTLE-RACE.</p>
