		<p>No. 1. --- Do not expect to get along entirely without trouble. Difficulties 
		  will arise of a more or less serious nature. Poor thread, defective 
		  needles, bad oil, etc., lead to these; and, remember; that you yourselves 
		  are liable to make mistakes in threading and handling the Machine. Should 
		  it fail to give satisfactory results, in any particular point, refer 
		  at once to the directions for that point, and they will always help 
		  you out.</p>

		  or the Machine is not properly threaded; or the upper tension is too 
		  tight; or the needle is too small for the thread; or the eye of the 
		  needle is sharp or rough; or the point of the needle is bent or broken; 
		  or the Machine has turned <i>toward</i> you instead of from you, or

		  tight; or the tension spring <i>may have got bent.</i></p>

		  for the size of the thread used will also be apt to break the needles.</p>

		  enough to lay the threads smoothly yet not so tight as to pucker the

		<p>NOTE. --- A short stitch will bear a <i>tighter</i> tension than a 
		  long one; so it is well when you lengthen the stitch to<i> loosen </i>the 
		  <i>upper</i> tension a little, <i>especially on fine goods.</i></p>

		<p>No. 8. --- The main cause of Machine running hard is <i>gummed oil</i>. 
		  Oil Machine with kerosene, <i>run until perfectly free</i>, then wipe 
		  clean and oil afresh with good oil. Too tight a belt will also cause 
		  the Machine to run heavy; whilst too <i>loose</i> a belt will slip,

		<p>No. 9. --- BAD THREAD. --- Whilst nearly all the different makes of 
		  <i>thread</i> are good, and give satisfactory results, some are so bad 
		  as to be unfit for machine use, and some even of the best, from being 
		  too exposed to dampness, will become spotted with mildew. Such thread 
		  if put on the Machine, will give trouble in breaking, <i>as a matter 
		  of course. </i>See that your thread is of good quality and free from 
		  &quot;knots&quot;. <i>Never wind a &quot;knot&quot; on the bobbin. </i></p>
		<p>The PRESSER FOOT should never be let down on the FEED, unless when 
		  you are sewing and have cloth under it.</p>
		<p>Do not run the Machine with either of the shuttle slides open.</p>
		<p>Do not use a dull or bent needle, or draw the work faster than the 
		  feed will naturally carry it. Needles are frequently broken by failing 
		  to observe the latter caution.</p>
