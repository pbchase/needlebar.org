<hr>
<p align="center">Every Sewing Machine sent out from the factory is made of the 
  best material and most carefully adjusted, so that after careful unpacking it 
  can be used at once. But before beginning to sew, it is advisable to read these 
  instructions carefully through first, even if you are experienced with the machine.</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#CC3333">All the bright parts of the machine are 
  well greased before it is sent off, so as to prevent rusting. When the machine 
  is unpacked, wipe away the grease and any dirt that may have come into it by 
  using paraffin oil (US = kerosene - AQ), and then re-oil the machine with the 
  best sewing-machine-oil.</font></p>
<p align="center">All machines leave the works with the hand-wheel disconnected 
  from the mechanism in order not to disturb the proper threading which is shown 
  in <font color="#CC3333">Fig. 2</font> and<font color="#CC3333"> 5</font>.<img src="fig01.jpg" width="196" height="272" align="right" vspace="20" hspace="20"></p>
<p align="center">To <font color="#CC3333">set the handmachine in motion</font>, 
  turn the china handle <font color="#CC3333">3 Fig. 1</font> in its joint, till 
  it snaps in. Then turn the little knob <font color="#CC3333">2 Fig. 1</font> 
  on the spoke of the hand-wheel round so far as to fit the little pin into the 
  slot. After this the hand-wheel has to be turned till the lengthened end of 
  the knob enters the hole provided for in the large cog-wheel. Thus, the machine 
  is ready for sewing.</p>
<p align="center">To disconnect the movement of the machine, draw back the little 
  knob <font color="#CC3333">2 Fig. 1</font> on the spoke and turn it somewhat. 
  Then pull out the china handle and turn it as <font color="#CC3333">practice 
  to guide the work</font> by placing a piece of material underneath the presser-foot 
  without having the machine threaded. Let down the presser-foot by the lever 
  <font color="#CC3333">4 Fig. 2</font> and then turn the hand-wheel slowly always 
  in the direction shown by arrow in <font color="#CC3333">Fig. 3</font> i.e. 
  away from you. You may fix a piece of paper on the material with straight and 
  curved pencil lines drawn on same and guide the material over these lines under 
  the needle by operating the machine.</p>
<p align="center">Sewing over thick seams should be done slowly and when sewing 
  square corners leave the needle in the material at the end of the seam, lift 
  the presser-bar a little and turn the material in the desired direction.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">Large and Small Stitches</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">The length of the stitches can be practised at the same time. 
  The stitch regulating thumb-screw <font color="#CC3333">1 Fig. 2</font> is found 
  just below the winder. If this screw is loosened and pushed towards the right, 
  the stitch becomes larger and if it is pushed towards the left, the stitch becomes 
  smaller. When the desired length of stitch is obtained this screw should be 
  tightened again, so as to prevent its moving.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="fig02.jpg" width="450" height="268"></p>
<p align="center"><b>For filling the bobbins with cotton the</b></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">Bobbin-winder</font></b></h3>
<div align="center">
  <p>is used. The machine is supplied with the ratchet bobbin-winder <font color="#CC3333">Fig. 
    2</font> and <font color="#CC3333">Fig. 3</font>, <font color="#000000">which</font><font color="#CC3333"> 
    releases itself automatically when the bobbin is full. The ratchet bobbin-winder 
    is very easy to work, not exposed to any interruptions and gives a tight and 
    clean convoluted bobbin.</font></p>
  <p><b><img src="fig03.jpg" width="425" height="328" vspace="15" hspace="15"></b></p>
  <p>The thread is passed through the tension disks <font color="#CC3333">5 Fig. 
    2</font>, then first through the eye <font color="#CC3333">A</font> of the 
    thread-guide <font color="#CC3333">F Fig. 3</font> and secondly through the 
    eye <font color="#CC3333">B</font> of same.</p>
  <p>When <font color="#CC3333">inserting the bobbin</font> press the flap <font color="#CC3333">C</font> 
    of <font color="#CC3333">Fig. 3</font> down, pull back the piston<font color="#CC3333"> 
    D</font> and insert first one end of the bobbin, then the other so that the 
    small pin on the right side passes into the hole of the bobbin. The end of 
    the thread is passed through this little hole from left to right and jammed 
    between this end of the bobbin and the winder. Take care that the thread-guide 
    F Fig. 3 is in position to the right hand in order to obtain a full and smoothly 
    filled bobbin. By <font color="#CC3333">lightly pressing the winder to the 
    front</font> it is set i motion. It will be found that the winder releases 
    <font color="#CC3333">itself</font> as soon as the bobbin is full.</p>
  <p><font color="#000000"><img src="fig03a.jpg" width="383" height="310" vspace="15" hspace="15" align="right"></font>Should 
    the bobbin get too full, turn the little regulating screw <font color="#CC3333">E</font> 
    of the flap <font color="#CC3333">C</font> to the left, or if it does not 
    get full enough turn the same screw a little to the right.If you do not understand 
    it properly, ask for the advice of an expert, so that the apparatus is not 
    spoilt through ignorance.</p>
  <h3><b><font color="#660000">The Fixing of the Bobbin-winder</font></b></h3>
  <p>The whole bobbin-winder is attached to the arm of the machine by a round 
    pin which is fastened by means of a small screw <font color="#CC3333">Fig. 
    3 A <font color="#000000">and by loosening same the whole winder can be taken 
    off.</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">To place the apparatus in its right position again, 
    the following is to be noticed. When putting a full bobbin into the winder, 
    the flap <font color="#CC3333">C Fig 3</font> should be tight on the bobbin 
    and the winder is to be pushed in until the little brass cog-wheel engages 
    the cog of the hand-wheel and then tighten the fastening screw <font color="#CC3333">Fig. 
    3 A</font>.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">This is especially to be considered when it is necessary 
    to take off the bobbin-winder for repairing purposes.</font></p>
  <h3><b><font color="#660000">The Needle</font></b></h3>
  <p><b>Flat-shanked needles are to be used only.</b></p>
  <p><img src="needle.jpg" width="498" height="69"></p>
  <p>The needle has on one side a long groove and on the other a short one and 
    must be fixed so that the long groove is towards you.</p>
  <p><b><img src="fig04.jpg" width="384" height="450" vspace="15" hspace="15"></b></p>
  <p>The needle-bar being at its highest and the wing-screw of the needle-clamp 
    loosened, push the needle from below, the long groove to the front, as high 
    as it will go into the needle clamp. When the needle stops at point <font color="#CC3333">B 
    Fig. 4</font> above the needle-clamp, it is in position, and the wing-screw 
    can be tightened again. Be sure that the plane <font color="#CC3333">A</font> 
    of the needle lies on the plane <font color="#CC3333">B</font> of the needle-bar. 
    The needle-eye must point to the front.</p>
  <p>Perfect work can only be produced if the needle is in proper position passing 
    through the middle of the hole in the throat-plate and neither blunt nor bent, 
    as this would cause defective stitches. The size of the needle must be chosen 
    in proportion to the thickness of the thread and the table on page 11 will 
    be a guide for selecting the needle-size for the thread you are using. Wrong 
    needles cause missing of stitches and make bad seams.<img src="fig05.jpg" width="197" height="450" align="right" vspace="15" hspace="15"></p>
  <h3><font color="#660000">The Threading of the Upper Thread</font></h3>
  
</div>
<p align="center">is very easy. As each machine is sent out properly threaded, 
  one should, after unpacking the machine, look at the thread as shown in <font color="#CC3333">Fig. 
  2 and 5</font>.</p>
<p align="center">It runs from the reel which is on the reel-pin through the eyelet 
  <font color="#CC3333">4</font> of the front-plate, then downwards between the 
  tension-disks <font color="#CC3333">5</font>, form there on to the thread-lever 
  <font color="#CC3333">6</font> and then down again through the eyelet <font color="#CC3333">7</font> 
  to the needle. It should be passed through the eye of the needle from the front 
  and pulled through for about 2 inches.</p>
<p align="center">When threading the machine the presser-foot-lifter <font color="#CC3333">E</font> 
  should be raised so as to release the tension and allow the cotton to be easily 
  passed between the tension-disks. It is only after the presser-foot-lifter is 
  let down that the tension can be regulated.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">The Threading of the Cylinder Shuttle</font></b></h3>
<div align="center">
  <p>is most simple, in fact the shuttle, as it will be seen in the following 
    illustrations, is almost self-threading. Hold the shuttle in your left hand, 
    drop the bobbin with your right hand into the shuttle, <font color="#CC3333">but 
    in such a manner that the thread comes off the bobbin from the upper side 
    and form left to right</font> (i.e. the bobbin-disk with hole on the top <font color="#CC3333">Fig 
    7</font>).</p>
  <p>When the bobbin is pushed into the shuttle, the thread is pulled downwards 
    between the slit of the shuttle by putting</p>
  <p><b><img src="fig06.jpg" width="480" height="133" vspace="15" hspace="15"></b></p>
  <p>the right hand downwards a little to the left like Fig. 8 shows. Then the 
    thread is pulled round the slit upwards, whereby it slides by itself into 
    the spring. With a sudden jerk it jumps under the thread-holder of the spring 
    (Fig 9) and is under the tongue of the tension-spring.</p>
  <p><img src="fig07.jpg" width="388" height="450" vspace="20" hspace="20"></p>
  <p>It is advisable when threading the shuttle to press the forefinger of the 
    left hand slightly on the top of the inserted bobbin, so as to prevent the 
    bobbin from falling out. The tension of the shuttle-spring is regulated by 
    the small screw A Fig 6 in the shuttle. <font color="#CC3333">The tension 
    is right when the thread can be pulled out with a little resistance</font> 
    (<font color="#CC3333">Fig 11</font>)</p>
  <p><b><img src="fig09.jpg" width="261" height="433" vspace="15" hspace="15"></b></p>
  <p>When placing the shuttle into the machine, the thread should be pulled out 
    about 2 inches, so that it can be taken up by the upper thread. Care should 
    be taken that no bits of cotton or dust collect in the shuttle or under the 
    shuttle-spring, otherwise the bobbin will turn irregularly, the thread might 
    break and the machine be put out of order.</p>
  <h2><b><font color="#660000">The Shuttle</font></b></h2>
  <h2><img src="shuttle.jpg" width="380" height="108"></h2>
</div>
<div align="center">
  <p>is put into the machine in the following way. Turn the wheel until the needle-bar 
    is at its lowest point, pull out the left slide of the shuttle-race <font color="#CC3333">Fig 
    10</font> as far as it will go and place the shuttle with the point towards 
    the right and the flat side to the front. This should be done very carefully, 
    not by force, so as not to damage the carrier. The hand-wheel should not be 
    turned until the shuttle is properly put in and the slide closed. In order 
    to remove the shuttle, one should simply <font color="#CC3333">bring the needle-bar 
    to its lowest point</font> and pull out the slide, which is provided with 
    a shuttle-ejector. The shuttle-ejector lifts the shuttle up itself, so that 
    you can easily catch hold of it with 2 fingers (<font color="#CC3333">Fig 
    10</font>) </p>
  <p><img src="fig10.jpg" width="450" height="321"></p>
  <p><font color="#CC3333">Screw-driver, scissors or other instruments must not 
    be used for taking out the shuttle</font>, as by doing this the tension-spring 
    gets bent and the machine will not work properly.</p>
  <h3><b><font color="#660000">Before beginning to sew</font></b></h3>
  <p>one should get up the lower thread. This is done by holding the upper thread 
    slightly with the left hand, turning the hand-wheel towards you with the right 
    hand until the needle has passed through the needle-plate and has come up 
    again to its highest point, by which the lower thread has been brought up 
    through the hole of the needle plate, so that it can easily be pulled out. 
    Then the two threads should be laid under the sewing-foot towards the back.</p>
  <p>Now the sewing can begin. Place the material under the sewing-foot, bring 
    this down by pressing the foot-lever E Fig 5 and begin to sew.</p>
  <p>Sewing over thick seams should be done slowly, as otherwise the needle might 
    easily be bent or broken.</p>
  <p>When wishing to remove the material, turn the hand-wheel of the machine so 
    that the thread lever 6 Fig 5 stands at its highest, lift the foot-lever E 
    Fig 5 and pull the material slowly towards the back. The threads should be 
    cut so that the ends are still 2 inches long.Never pull the material towards 
    you as this might bend the needle, which afterwards might easily damage the 
    needle-plate and this is often the cause of irregular stitches, broken cotton 
    and needles.</p>
  <h3><b><font color="#660000">The Thread-tension</font></b></h3>
  
  <p>As faultless work can only be produced through a proper tension it is advisable 
    to give special attention to the regulation of same. When starting a seam, 
    be sure that the tension of the upper thread <font color="#000000">(<font color="#CC3333">Fig 
    5</font>)</font> as well as of the shuttle <font color="#000000">(<font color="#CC3333">Fig 
    9</font>)</font> is equal.</p>
  <p>If both, the upper and the lower thread have equal tension and cros each 
    other in the middle of the material so that the stitches appear on both sides 
    of the material as equal as possible, as is shown in the cross-section, the 
    tension is right and you may begin to work.</p>
