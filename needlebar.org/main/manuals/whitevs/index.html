<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">TO WIND THE BOBBIN</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Slip the clutch out of the fly wheel so that the balance wheel 
  will revolve without running the machine, then turn the bobbin winder adjuster 
  screw at the bottom of the bobbin winder until the rubber pulley comes into 
  contact with the balance wheel. Place the bobbin in the winder, then down behind 
  the winder frame until it slips into the notch at the bottom of the frame.</p>
<p align="center">Holding the thread taut in the left hand, slide the grooved 
  pulley on the curved shaft to the right then place the spring pad to rest against 
  the bobbin. Lastly, proceed to wind the bobbin by running the machine, allowing 
  the thread to pass through the hand to steady it, and the bobbin will wind itself 
  automatically.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">TO THREAD BOBBIN CASE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Take the shuttle in the left hand, the point toward you. Drop 
  the bobbin into the shuttle so that the thread will unwind from the right hand 
  side of the bobbin. Pass the thread into the slot, holding the thread slightly 
  taut by pressure of the left forefinger upon the end of the bobbin.</p>
<p align="center">Draw the thread toward you, release the pressure on the bobbin 
  soon as the thread comes against the lip of the shuttle spring, and it will 
  readily draw under it. Then, pass the thread to the right and down, back under 
  both shuttle springs and again holding the thread taut as before, tighten the 
  thread by drawing it straight toward the heel of the shuttle until the thread 
  passes under the other lip of the shuttle spring. The shuttle is then ready 
  for use.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">TO REPLACE THE BOBBIN CASE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">To replace the bobbin case, simply slip it on the pin in shuttle 
  with the tension projecting upward, and push it into shuttle, as far as it will 
  go, when the spring latch will pass over and retain it in that position.</p>
<p align="center">The thread should be allowed to project about two incehs from 
  the bobbin case tension.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">DIRECTIONS FOR UPPER THREADING<img src="thread.jpg" width="433" height="580" align="right" vspace="20" hspace="20"></font></b></h3>
<p align="center">1. Place your machine in proper position for threading by raising 
  the presser foot, using the lever at the back of the face, then turn the hand 
  wheel so the takeup<font color="#CC3333"> 8</font> is at its highest point.</p>
<p align="center">2. Place the spool of thread on the spool pin <font color="#CC3333">1</font>, 
  use the first finger and thumb of the right hand to put a slight tension on 
  the thread while doing the subsequent threading operation. Then take the end 
  of the the thread between the thumb and first finger of the left hand; place 
  the thread around the rivet <font color="#CC3333">2</font> from back to front; 
  then towards the rear of the face under the washer <font color="#CC3333">3</font>; 
  then through the notch <font color="#CC3333">4</font>. Next take the thread 
  and hook it under the point <font color="#CC3333">5</font> of the tension plate, 
  hooking under from the side of the machine nearest you. Move the hand toward 
  the back, and pull the thread upward until it passes through the eye of the 
  auxiliary spring <font color="#CC3333">6</font>, and into notch <font color="#CC3333">7</font>. 
  We now pull the thread upwards, hooking it into the spring on the end of the 
  take-up <font color="#CC3333">8</font>. </p>
<p align="center">All these steps can be done without changing the position of 
  the thread between the thumb and first finger.</p>
<p align="center">We now place the thread through the guide <font color="#CC3333">9</font> 
  on end of the needle bar, which is done by pulling it in through the slot. We 
  are now ready to snip off the end of the thread, and thread it through the needle, 
  threading from the left to the right. Allow about two inches of thread to project 
  beyond the needle when the take-up is at its highest point.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">TO DRAW UP THE LOWER THREAD</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Hold the end of the upper thread loosely in the left hand, and 
  with the right hand gently revolve the hand-wheel, turning the top side from 
  you until the needle passes to its lowest point and returns. A loop will be 
  formed through which shuttle will pass, and, as the needle ascends it will draw 
  up the lower or shuttle thread. The ends of the threads should then be passed 
  under and to the rear of presser-foot. The machine is now ready for sewing.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000"><img src="02.jpg" width="217" height="258" align="left" vspace="20" hspace="20"><font color="#CC0000">TO 
  REGULATE THE TENSION</font></font></b></h3>
<p align="center">To loosen the tension, turn the thumbscrew on the dial to the 
  left that will move the pointer towards number 1. To tighten it, turn to the 
  right, moving the pointer towards number 8. </p>
<p align="center">By this means the same tension can always be duplicated, thus 
  obviating the necessity of experimental trials, as in the case with other machines. 
</p>
<p align="center">If a tight tension is desired, both upper and under threads 
  must necessarily be tight. If the upper thread is tight and the lower thread 
  loose the upper thread will be drawn to the top thus:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="03.jpg" width="341" height="54"></p>
<p align="center">If the lower thread is too tight it will be drawn straight on 
  the bottom of goods, thus:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="04.jpg" width="340" height="51"></p>
<p align="center">When you desire the stitches to look alike on both sides and 
  to be elastic, balance the tension thus:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="05.jpg" width="339" height="48"></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">LOWER TENSION</font></h3>
<p align="center">To regulate the lower tension, turn tension adjusting screw 
  on the bobbin case to the right to tighten, and to the left to loosen same.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">THE TENSION RELEASER</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">The tension releaser is operated by the presser bar lifter lever. 
  By means of it, all tension is taken off the upper thread when the presser-foot 
  is raised, and the work can be taken out without pulling the thread down by 
  hand.</p>
<p align="center">Always regulate tension of upper thread when presser foot is 
  down.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">TO REMOVE SHUTTLE FROM SHUTTLE RACE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">First remove the bobin case. Turn the head back on its hinges, 
  then turn the handwheel from you in the same direction as in sewing, until the 
  point of the needle just enters the needle-plate hole; push on rear end of latch 
  and at the same time pull shuttle-race cover away from shuttle and toward latch 
  from under pin; the shuttle can now be removed.</p>
<p align="center">When shuttle has been removed from race be sure to clean both 
  and oil the race slightly before replacing. Occasionally oil slightly pin in 
  shuttle. Also see that no thread is wound around bottom of center pin.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">TO REPLACE THE SHUTTLE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Turn the hand-wheel from you until the point of the needle just 
  enters the needle plate hole; take the shuttle by the center pin with the left 
  hand and place it in the race, so that the point of shuttle will be from you 
  and over arrow, this is imperative, so that the holes on the shuttle will drop 
  on to driving pins in race, then replace the shuttle race cover.</p>
<p align="center">DO NOT FORCE the shuttle into race. It will enter readily when 
  in proper position.</p>
<p align="center">Should the machine at any time act badly in sewing or running, 
  remove shuttle, clean it and the race, which is but a moment's work.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">TO CHANGE THE LENGTH OF STITCH</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">The stitch regulator is located at the right end of machine 
  on the front side of arm. TO SHORTEN stitch move the lever down. TO LENGTHEN 
  stitch move lever up. No.1 indicates the shortest, and No. 7 the longest stitch.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#CC0000">TO OIL THE MACHINE<img src="06.jpg" width="501" height="580" align="right" vspace="20" hspace="20"></font></b></h3>
<p align="center">To ensure easy running, the machine requires oiling, and if 
  used continuously, it should be oiled each day. With moderate use, an occasional 
  oiling is sufficient. Oil should be applied at each of the places shown by arrows. 
  One drop of oil at each point is sufficient. Oil holes are provided in the machine 
  for bearings that can not readily be reached.</p>
<p align="center">To oil the mechanism under the bobbin cover plate, draw the 
  front slide toward you and after removing the lint and dust which may have accumulated, 
  put a few drops of oil on the wick which is retained in the hole in the bed 
  of the machine. The slide should then be closed.</p>
<p align="center">On the top of the arm is a rectangular cover plate, fastened 
  by a thumb screw. Loosen the screw, and remove the plate, turn the balance wheel 
  slowly and oil the moving parts inside, then replace the cover and fasten it 
  as before.</p>
<p align="center">To reach the parts underneath the bed the belt must be thrown 
  off the band wheel in the machine stand. The places to be oiled are indicated 
  in the illustration, by arrows pointed to the oil holes and bearings.</p>
