<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>To Put the 
  Stand Together</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Place the two side frames so that 
  the projections at the top are on the inside; put the treadle in its place with 
  its heel towards the front, connect the two sides by placing the cross-bar across 
  the lower part of the stand under the toe of the treadle; place the lower ends 
  of the cross-brace in the holes at either end of the cross-bar and the upper 
  ends in the corresponding places at the top of the side frames; place the top 
  or table on the side frames, taking care that the lugs on its under side pass 
  through the projections on the side frames, and secure the whole by driving 
  the pins through the lugs of the table underside the projections on the side 
  frames.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This being done, place the machine 
  on the tables, connecting the treadle with the driving-wheel by the wooden pitman.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>To Oil the 
  Machine</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oil the hinge of the check-lever, 
  the needle-bar at the top on both sides, the needle- cam and roller, the foot-bar 
  both at the upper and under brass; also oil the holes at either end of the arm 
  and on the bed of the machine; by turning the balance-wheel, an oil-hole, which 
  must be oiled, will appear through the large hole in the base of the gear-cover; 
  also oil the hole at the right end of the under-shaft. Remove the shuttle- race 
  slide, and oil the slide of the shuttle-driver, and also oil the shuttle race 
  a very little, about three times a week. On the underside of the machine the 
  shuttle-pitman should be oiled at either end; also the feed-cam and the end 
  of the rock-shaft that rests on the cam; also the holes in which the rock-shaft 
  works, and the pin on which the feed-dog works, a little oil should be put upon 
  the feed-wheel hub and stud occasionally, and when in use the spooler should 
  be oiled. Be sure not to oil anything about the feed-wheel except the stud, 
  oil both sides of the treadle, and the wooden pitman at both ends; and finally, 
  as a general rule, oil every part where one piece rubs against another. After 
  oiling, remove the shuttle, and run the machine rapidly a minute, then wipe 
  off all superfluous oil with a piece of rag or cotton waste. Be sure that every 
  part is clean before you commence to sew. If the machine runs hard at any time 
  while in use, it is certain some place has not been oiled. If it runs hard after 
  standing idle for some time, use a little paraffine or benzine on the wearing 
  points, run rapidly, and wipe clean; then oil with the best prepared sperm oil, 
  which should always be used. To make sure of good oil, buy it at one of the 
  Company&#8217;s offices or from its authorized agents.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>To Operate 
  the Treadle</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Place the centre of the foot (one 
  or both) on the treadle in such a manner that both heel and toe may be used 
  in turning the machine; then take hold of the balance-wheel on the upper side 
  and draw it towards you, allowing the foot to move freely with the motion thus 
  imparted, and continue the motion of the foot by a pressure upon the heel and 
  tow alternately, until a regular motion is acquired; until this is done sewing 
  should not be attempted.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>To Set the 
  Needle</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">First, loosen with the screw-driver 
  the screw that clamps the needle, and allow the needle-bar to rest at its highest 
  point; then take the needle (with its short groove towards the shuttle) between 
  the thumb and finger of the left hand, and place the point down through the 
  hole in the throat-plate; hold fast while you turn the balance-wheel gently 
  towards you until the needle-bar moves downward to admit of your guiding the 
  needle into the groove under the clamp; adjust the needle so that the eye will 
  be just even with the upper surface of the throat-plate and at right angles 
  with the shuttle- race, turning the balance wheel gently either way as required, 
  until the gauge mark (a distinct line graven in the front of the needle-bar, 
  near the top) rests even or full above <br>
  the top of the face-plate; then screw fast, taking care to make each of the 
  two screws draw equally upon the clamp. Observe that the needle passes through 
  the hole in the throat-plate without touching either side. As a rule, it should 
  be nearest to the side towards the shuttle. When using coarse cotton or linen 
  thread, set the needle a sixteenth of an inch lower, and use the throat-plate 
  with large hole.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>To Wind the 
  Bobbin</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Raise the presser-foot with the 
  presser-bar lifter, remove the shuttle, adjust the small driving band used for 
  imparting motion to the bobbin-winder around the balance-wheel and the bobbin-winder 
  pulley; place the spool of thread to be wound from on its spindle, and place 
  the bobbin in the bobbin-winder. To secure the end of the thread preparatory 
  to winding, place it between the head of the bobbin and the cup at the end of 
  the bobbin-winder spindle; then proceed to operate the treadle as in sewing, 
  letting the thread pass gently between the thumb and forefinger of the right 
  hand, which should be held about fifteen inches from and on a line with the 
  bobbin-winder, so that the thread may be evenly and tightly wound upon the bobbin. 
  Very much depends upon the proper winding of the bobbin.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>To Thread 
  the Shuttle</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the shuttle between the thumb 
  and the forefingers of the left hand with the point to the right. Place the 
  bobbin within the shuttle by putting one end in the hole or centre, towards 
  the point; then pass the other end down the groove in the blunt end, always 
  placing the bobbin so that the thread will draw from its under side: pass it 
  through the hole nearest the blunt end of the shuttle; then through as many 
  holes as shall be necessary to produce the tension required; but last, in every 
  case through the hole nearest the point, either outward or inward. In the latter 
  case pass it out through the long slot, and, in all cases, lastly, under the 
  thread guide or spring, on the side of the shuttle.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>To Thread 
  the Needle</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The spool being placed on its spindle, 
  pass the thread through the eye at the end of the tension wire, and through 
  the eye at the end of the thread thread-take-up lever; then hook the two parts 
  of the thread &#8211; namely, that ascending to the take-up lever: from the 
  tension wire, and that descending from the take-up lever to the needle, into 
  the hook at the lower end of the wire-staple on the face-plate. In other words, 
  the thread should pass from the tension wire through the hook at the lower end 
  of the wire staple on the face-plate; then up through the eye at the end of 
  the take-up lever, then down through the hook in the lower end of the wire-staple, 
  then through the hole or eye in the needle-clamp, on the lower end of the needle-bar, 
  and finally, from left to right, through the eye of the needle.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>To Regulate 
  the Tensions</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">After threading the shuttle, try 
  by drawing the thread towards the blunt end; if it draws as tightly as it will 
  bear without breaking, it is right for goods of firm texture; thin soft goods 
  require a looser tension. To obtain more or less tension, pass the thread through 
  more or less holes, as described above.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The tension on the needle-thread 
  is obtained by turning the tension-wing over towards the operator; take hold 
  of the thread just above the needle and draw it downwards from the spool, and 
  continue to turn the tension-wing until the thread draws as tightly as it will 
  bear without breaking. For thin, soft goods, the same rule applies for the needle 
  as for the shuttle-tension.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>To Commence 
  Sewing</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Place the shuttle in position in 
  the shuttle-race, leaving about two inches of thread projecting, and close the 
  slide; then draw about two inches of the upper thread through the eye of the 
  needle, and with the left hand hold the end, leaving it slack from the hand 
  to the needle, while you turn the wheel gently towards you until the needle 
  moves down and up again to its highest point, then gently draw the needle-thread, 
  and the shuttle-thread will appear; draw the end of the shuttle-thread through 
  the hole in the throat-piece, when the two threads should be laid to the left 
  across the feed-wheel; then place the fabric beneath the needle, lower the presser-foot 
  upon it, and operate the treadle. After a few stitches are formed, stop and 
  examine them. The secret of perfect sewing lies in the adjustment of the tensions 
  so that the stitches shall be locked in the centre of the goods and show alike 
  on both sides. The adjustment of either tension may be regulated as before described.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>To Remove 
  the Work</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow the needle to rest at its 
  highest point, taking hold of the thread just above the needle, and drawing 
  from the spool about three inches slack; then raise the presser- foot, and with 
  the left hand draw the fabric from the left side upwards about three inches; 
  then cut both threads.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Regulating 
  the Length of the Stitch</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">On the side of the machine next 
  the operator at the left hand corner, and below the table of the machine, are 
  two brass nuts, which are used for adjusting the stitch. By screwing up these 
  nuts, the stitch will be lengthened, and by reversing the action it will be 
  shortened. These two nuts, when the length of the stitch is determined, should 
  be screwed tight together, which will prevent their moving by the operation 
  of the machine.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>General Remarks</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">For stitching patent leather and 
  other materials which are hard and difficult or perforation, the Imperial Machines 
  are used. They are furnished with an iron cup, to hold a drying oil. Boiled 
  linseed oil, prepared with litharge in the manner used by painters, is the proper 
  oil for this purpose. The effect of thus oiling the thread is, to prevent heating 
  the needle, and to make the stitching of leather as rapid and easy as cloth 
  sewing. The silk twist, after being oiled, rapidly dries, and is left with its 
  surface as smooth and perfect as if no oil had been used &#8211; and the firmness 
  of the seam is improved by it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The machines are sent out with the 
  feed-wheel set for medium work &#8211; neither heavy nor light. When sewing 
  thin goods lower, and for very heavy goods raise the feed-wheel. This can be 
  done by loosening the nut which holds the feed-wheel stud in place, and moving 
  the wheel to the desired position; then screw fast.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the feed-wheel fails to make 
  a uniform length of stitch, it must be well cleaned, and the block pressing 
  against its left side must be made to press more firmly, which is accomplished 
  by turning the screw that holds it in place to the right; this may be done by 
  means of the small wrench furnished with each machine.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">At the top of the needle-bar is 
  a staple fastened by a washer and screw, which will seldom need to be disturbed; 
  but in case very heavy goods are to be sewed, it may be necessary to lower it 
  a little in order to obtain more slack thread. The following rule should be 
  followed in adjusting this staple: first put a white thread in the eye of the 
  needle, and the number of thicknesses of the goods to be sewed under the needle, 
  in a proper position for operating. Then move the machine directly until the 
  needle descends so that the needle eye is directly at the upper surface of the 
  cloth; then resting there, bring the staple of the needle-bar in contact with 
  the upper surface of the horizontal wire check-lever, and then screw the staple 
  firmly in its place.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Each machine is furbished with two 
  sets of check-springs and presser-springs &#8211; one heavy, the other light 
  &#8211; to be used for corresponding classes of work.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Twist Linen 
  and Cotton Threads</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not use poor thread. Any good 
  thread will work well, but you must not expect to make a smooth even stitch, 
  with poor rough thread. Persons living at a distance from an agency can send 
  by mail enclosing us the money, and we will fill orders promptly by mail or 
  express.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#3300FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Extras</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We furnish with each machine one 
  extra throat-plate, one extra check-spring, one extra presser-spring, one large 
  wrench, one small wrench, one spooler band, six needles, and copy of printed 
  directions.</font></p>

  Needles and Thread</strong></font></p>
