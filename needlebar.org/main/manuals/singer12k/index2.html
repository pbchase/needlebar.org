<h4 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">A few special notes are added below in 
  explanation of any adjustment that may be necessary.</font></h4>
<P><font color="#660000">THE SLACK THREAD PIN</font> (12) presses down the check 
  lever (15). It is adjusted properly for all classes of general sewing, and should 
  never be altered unless the thread breaks in sewing very thick cloth; then loosen 
  the screw (14), and slightly lower the the slack thread pin, after which retighten 
  the screw. Should it become displaced, it should be re-adjusted so that it begins 
  to press down the check lever when the needle gauge mark is one-eighth of an 
  inch above the top of the arm.</P>
<P><font color="#660000">THE CHECK SPRING</font> (16) draws up the check lever 
  (15). Should it break or wear out, insert another as follows:- Move the needle 
  bar (9) until its check mark is level with the top of the arm. Remove the screw 
  that holds the spring, draw out the check lever half its length, holding it 
  while putting in the spring with its hooked end outwards, then move the check 
  lever back into ita place. Replace the screw, turning it a few times only, press 
  down the end of the spring into the first hole (or into the second or third 
  hole, if using coarse thread), then tighten the screw.</P>
<P><font color="#660000">THE PRESSURE SCREW</font> (19) regulates the pressure 
  upon the material. Turn it to the left to increase the pressure, and to the 
  right to decrease it. Fabrics of thick or firm texture require more pressure 
  than thin and soft fabrics.</P>
<P><font color="#660000">IF THE NEEDLE THREAD BREAKS </font>when the needle is 
  adjusted properly, it is caused by the tension being too tight, the eye of the 
  needle being too small, the slack thread pin becoming displaced (see Note above), 
  a roughness on the shuttle or its carrier, or by the point of the needle being 
  bent.</P>
<P><font color="#660000">IF THE SHUTTLE THREAD BREAKS</font>, loosen the tension 
  by passing the thread through fewer holes. (See page 4, "To Thread the Shuttle")</P>
<P><font color="#660000">IF THERE ARE MISSED STITCHES</font>, they are caused 
  by the needle being adjusted too high or too low, being bent away from the shuttle, 
  being too small for the thread, or by the point of the shuttle having become 
  blunted.</P>
<P><font color="#660000">IF THE NEEDLE THREAD FORMS SMALL LOOPS</font> on the 
  top of the fabric, it is caused by the check spring (16) having become broken 
  (see Note above), and sometimes, when sewing with coarse silk or linen thread, 
  by the needle being too fine or its point being bent.</P>
<P><font color="#660000">IF THE STITCHES VARY IN LENGTH </font>while hemming or 
  sewing very thick and soft fabrics, loosen the feed raising cam (62), and move 
  it a little to the left to raise the feed points, then tighten it firmly. Do 
  not raise the feed points too high; when they descend in working they should 
  be a little below the surface of the throat plate.</P>
<P><font color="#660000">SEAMS IN HARD COTTON FABRICS</font> should be passed 
  over slowly, and if these are extra thick, rub them with a little white soap, 
  which will facilitate the passage of the needle.</P>
<P><font color="#660000">THE EXTRA THROAT PLATE</font>, which has a large hole, 
  is only required when using a No. 21 needle with 40 or 60 linen thread; never 
  use it for any other size. See page 12 for sizes of needles and threads.</P>
<P><font color="#660000">THE LEATHER BELT</font> must be tight enogh to work the 
  machine without slipping. If it is too loose, cut about half an inch from one 
  end, and rejoin.</P>
