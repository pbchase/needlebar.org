<P ALIGN="Center">The figures shown in the above illustrations are the numbers 
  of the parts. When ordering parts for this machine the numbers must be followed 
  by "12K", <I>e.g. 48 1/2 /12K.</I></P>
<HR>
<H3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#660000">BALANCE WHEEL STOP MOTION</font></H3>
<P>This device allows the balance wheel to run free, so that bobbins may be wound 
  and the correct method of treadling acquired, without operating the stitching 
  mechanism. To loosen the wheel, hold it with the left hand, and with the right 
  hand pull out the disc sufficiently to allow of its being turned either to the 
  right or left, thus liberating the projection on the inner side of the disc 
  from its recess.</P>
<P ALIGN="Center"><IMG SRC="12k02.jpg" ALT="Balance Wheel Diagram" HEIGHT="365" WIDTH="413"></P>
<P>To lock the balance wheel, hold it with the left hand and, with the right, 
  turn the disc until the projection springs back into its recess.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">TO ENSURE PERFECT ACTION OF THE MACHINE</font></H3>
<P>The balance wheel must always turn from the top towards you.</P>
<P>The presser foot must be raised, except when sewing.</P>
<P>Do not work the machine with the shuttle and the needle threaded, except when 
  sewing.</P>
<P>The slides (33) over the shuttle must be closed before starting work on the 
  machine.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">TO OPERATE THE TREADLE MACHINE</font></H3>
<P>Loosen the balance wheel as described above, place both feet upon the treadle 
  and turn the balance wheel over towards you, at the same time allowing the feet 
  to move freely and lightly with the motion of the treadle. Continue to do this 
  until a regular and easy movement is acquired and you are able to work the treadle 
  so that you can re-start the machine without the balance wheel turning in the 
  wrong direction.</P>
<P>When familiar with working movement, lock the balance wheel, and place a piece 
  of material under the presser foot (23). Lower the latter by means of the lifter 
  (25) and again work the machine, without its being threaded, until you are accustomed 
  to guiding the material.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">TO SET THE NEEDLE</font></H3>
<P>Raise the needle bar (9) to its highest point and loosen the needle clamp nut 
  (12). Hold the needle with the left hand and, with its long groove towards you, 
  place its point down through the hole in the throat plate (31). Turn the wheel 
  (88) slowly towards you, while you guide the the needle under the needle clamp 
  nut (12).</P>
<P>With the left hand insert the point of a fine needle into the eye, resting 
  it on the throat plate (31). Loosen the clamp nut or screw (12), and pressing 
  the fine needle into the eye in a direct line from you, turn the wheel (88) 
  slowly until the line engraved on the needle bar (9) is level with the top of 
  the arm. Then tighten the clamp nut or screw (12)</P>
<H3 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">TO THREAD THE NEEDLE</font></H3>
<P>Place a reel of thread on the spool pin nearest the balance wheel and lead 
  the end of the thread through the guide (4), then down from front to back under 
  and between the tension discs (6), up and from front to back through the hole 
  in the check lever (15), down and through the hole in the needle clamp (11), 
  then from front to back through the eye of the needle, leaving an end of thread 
  three inches long, which should be placed under and to the back of the presser 
  foot.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">TO WIND THE BOBBIN</font></H3>
<P>Withdraw the left slide and turn the balance wheel until the shuttle is in 
  full view, then lift it from the machine and remove the bobbin. Put a reel of 
  thread on the spool pin, place the bobbinin the spooler (41) and secure the 
  end of the thread by placing it between the end of the bobbin and the cup of 
  the spooler. Operate the machine and guide the thread upon the bobbin slowly 
  from one end to the other, always having the thread a trifle higher at the ends 
  than in the centre.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">TO THREAD THE SHUTTLE</font></H3>
<P>Having removed the bobbin from the spool winder, take it between the thumb 
  and finger of the right hand, being careful that the thread is over the bobbin 
  towards the hand. At the same time take the shuttle in the fingers of the left 
  with its point towards the hand, place one end of the bobbin in the spring centre 
  in the end of the shuttle cavity next to the point, and gently press the other 
  end into its place.</P>
<P>Pass the thread through the bottom long slot, in at the upper slot, and thence 
  over to the tension holes, passing it through the one nearest the blunt end 
  first, then through as many holes as may be necessary to obtain the tension 
  required, always finishing, however, by passing it through the hole nearest 
  the point, either from the inside outward, or from the outside inward (in the 
  latter case pass it out through the slot below) and finally, in every case, 
  under the spring.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">TO COMMENCE SEWING</font></H3>
<P>Open the left hand shuttle slide (33), place the shuttle in its carrier (57), 
  leaving out about two inches of thread. Close the slide to within an eighth 
  of an inch, draw out about two inches of thread down from the check lever (15) 
  and through the eye of the needle.</P>
<P>Hold the end of thread with the left hand, allowing it to be slack from the 
  hand to the needle, and turn the wheel (88) towards you until the needle moves 
  down and up again to its highest point. Pull the thread you are holding, and 
  the under thread will be brought up with it through the hole in the throat plate.</P>
<P>Close the slide, place both ends of the thread and the material to be sewn, 
  under the presser foot, lower the the presser bar lifter (25) and commence to 
  sew by turning the balance wheel from the top towards you.</P>
<P> After making a few stitches, stop and examine them. Should there be loops 
  projecting or a straight thread upon the lower surface, turn the tension screw 
  (5) on the top of the machine to the right, so as to tighten the tension on 
  the needle thread. </P>
<P>If the thread lies straight upon the upper surface, turn the tension screw 
  to the left to loosen the tension of the needle thread.</P>
<P>The secret of perfect sewing lies in adjusting the tension on the needle thread 
  and that on the shuttle thread so that they are equal.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">TO REMOVE THE WORK</font></H3>
<P>Raise the needle bar (9) to its highest point, draw about three inches of thread 
  downwards from the check lever (15), and raise the lifter (25). Move the material 
  back and to the left about three inches and cut the threads close to the work 
  so as to leave the ends long enough to recomence sewing.</P>
<P>Before removing the work from the machine, however, seams should be secured 
  by taking a few stitches in the opposite direction, as in hand sewing.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">TO REGULATE THE TENSIONS</font></H3>
<P>Test the tension of the shuttle thread by drawing it towards the round end 
  of the shuttle. If it draws as tightly as it will bear without breaking, it 
  is right for fabrics of firm texture. Thin, soft fabrics require less tension. 
  To obtain more or less tension, pass the thread through more or less holes. 
  (see page 4, "To Thread the Shuttle".)</P>
<P>The tension of the needle thread is regulated by turning the tension screw 
  (5). To test the tension, draw the thread downward from the check lever (15), 
  turning the screw (5) to the right, until the thread draws as tightly as it 
  will bear without breaking. For thin, soft fabrics less tension is required.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">TO ALTER THE LENGTH OF STITCH</font></H3>
<P>Loosen the screw (66) in the slot in the bed of the machine and move it to 
  the right to lengthen, or to the left to shorten the stitch. When the required 
  length of stitch is obtained tighten the screw.</P>
<P>The shortest possible stitch is obtained by changing the screw into the hole 
  at the end of the stitch regulator (65) and moving it to the left in the slot 
  as far as it will go.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="Center"><font color="#660000">TO OIL THE MACHINE AND STAND</font></H3>
<P>If used constantly, the machine should be oiled daily, while with moderate 
  use, an occasional oiling is sufficient, a drop of oil being applied at each 
  of the following places:<BR>
  <BR>
  the sides of the needle bar (9),<BR>
  in the four holes on the top of the arm,<BR>
  the two holes on the side of the arm,<BR>
  the shuttle carrier slide,<BR>
  both ends of the pitman (53) and the feed lever (61),<BR>
  the feed raising cam (62),<BR>
  the centre joint of the feed lever,<BR>
  and the slot of the feed guide.</P>
<P>To oil the stand, apply a drop of oil to the treadle bearings, both ends of 
  the wooden pitman and the axle of the band wheel.</P>
<P>After oiling, run the machine rapidly for a few minutes, afterwards wiping 
  off any superfluous oil.</P>
<P>If the machine works hard while in constant use it is certain that some place 
  requiring oil has been overlooked. If it works hard after being out of use for 
  some time, or after using inferior oil, use a little paraffin, run the machine 
  rapidly for a few minutes, wipe clean and then oil with Singer Superior Machine 
  Oil.</P>
