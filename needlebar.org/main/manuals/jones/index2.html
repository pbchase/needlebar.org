<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">SETTING OR ADJUSTING THE NEEDLE</font></h3>
<p align="center">The Needle in this Machine is self-setting, the operator simply 
  pushes the Needle up the hole in the Needle Bar <font color="#CC3333">as far 
  as it will go</font>, with the <font color="#CC3333">long groove</font> to the 
  <font color="#CC3333">left hand</font>; secure the Needle firmly with the Needle 
  Screw and the Needle <img src="fig04.jpg" width="389" height="609" align="left" vspace="20" hspace="20">is 
  perfectly set.</p>
<p align="center">Be sure the Needle point is <font color="#CC3333">sharp</font> 
  not <font color="#CC3333">blunt</font>. This is very important, particularly 
  so when sewing fine goods.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">-</font></b><b><font color="#660000">TO 
  THREAD THE MACHINE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Place the spool of thread on the Spool Pin, pass the thread 
  through the Eye marked <font size="+1" color="#CC3333">A</font>, then between 
  the Tension Discs <font size="+1" color="#CC3333">B</font>, and into the slot 
  in the Take-up Lever <font size="+1" color="#CC3333">D</font>, behind the Guides 
  <font color="#CC3333"> <font size="+1">E</font></font> and <font size="+1" color="#CC3333">F</font>, 
  and through the Needle Eye, the thread running through the Needle Eye from <font color="#CC3333">left</font> 
  to <font color="#CC3333">right</font>.</p>
<p align="center">The Needle or Top Thread Tension is adjusted by means of the 
  Milled-head Tension Nut <font size="+1" color="#CC3333">G</font> (<i>see illustration).</i></p>
<p align="center">By turning the Nut <font size="+1" color="#CC3333">G</font> 
  to the right hand, the tension is tightened or increased.</p>
<p align="center">By turning the Nut <font size="+1" color="#CC3333">G</font> 
  to the left hand, the tension is slackened or decreased.</p>
<p align="center">Always be sure that there is some tension on the top thread, 
  or it may tangle round the Shuttle.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO WIND THE SHUTTLE BOBBIN</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">First disconnect the Balance wheel by turning the large Milled 
  Head Nut at the end of the shaft (Fig 1) <font color="#CC3333">towards you</font>, 
  this will enable you to wind the Bobbin without running the machine, and avoids 
  the necessity of having to take the work from under the machines, or break the 
  thread.</p>
<p align="center">Place the end of the Bobbin in the Winder Centre <font color="#CC3333" size="+1">A</font><font color="#000000">, 
  forcing the Winder-Centre to the left far enough to allow the other end of the 
  Bobbin to go into the Cup-end of spindle <font color="#CC3333" size="+1">B</font>. 
  You will notice the Cup-end of Spindle is hollowed out, so that you may easily 
  see the Pin that goes into the hole in the end of the Bobbin.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Be sure that the hole in the end of the 
  Bobbin is right opposite the <font color="#CC3333">Pin <font color="#000000">in 
  the Cup-end of the Spindle <font color="#CC3333" size="+1">B</font>. Then push 
  the Bobbin Winder up aginst the the Balance Wheel, which will drive the Winder 
  whilst winding. Place the spool of thread on the Spool Pin and pass the thread 
  through the Eye <font color="#CC3333" size="+1">A</font>, (see Fig 4), then 
  through the Eye just above the Bobbin Winder and thence to the Winder.</font></font></font></p>

  position of Thread before commencing to wind</font></b></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">This Winder is self-acting, and winds 
  the thread on to the Bobbin as evenly and as regularly as an ordinary spool 
  of thread. It is the most simple and effective Bobbin Winder ever invented.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO TAKE THE SHUTTLE OUT OF THE MACHINE</font></h3>
<h2 align="center"><img src="fig05a.jpg" width="509" height="422"></h2>
<p align="center"><b>Never attempt to turn the Machine over for oiling <font color="#CC3333">with 
  the Back Shuttle Cover Slide part way out</font>, or you will damage the Machine.</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Withdraw the Front Shuttle Cover Slide. Turn the Balance 
  Wheel until the Shuttle Carrier is as near to the front of the Machine as it 
  will come.</b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#660000"><img src="fig06.jpg" width="212" height="500" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="25"></font>Press 
  down the <font color="#CC3333">Point</font> of the Shuttle with the <font color="#CC3333">Thumb</font> 
  and it will lift the back end of the Shuttle clean out of the Shuttle Carrier 
  (as illustrated)</b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#CC3333" size="+1">NEVER attempt to lift the 
  Shuttle out of the Carrier BY THE SPRING, or you may damage the Shuttle Tension.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="+1" color="#FFFFFF">-</font></b></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO THREAD JONES' CYLINDER SHUTTLE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Take the Shuttle in the left hand, between the thumb and the 
  two first fingers, with the Shuttle point towards you. Fig 6 shows you how to 
  put the Bobbin into the Shuttle. Be sure that the thread runs off the <font color="#CC3333">top 
  side of the Bobbin</font> (as illustrated). This is <font color="#CC3333"><i>very</i></font> 
  important. </p>
<p align="center">Press the end of the Bobbin down to the bottom of the Shuttle 
  and hold it there with the fore-finger, and with the right hand pull the thread 
  down the slot in the shuttle as far as it will go (see Fig 6).</p>
<p align="center">Now pull the thread back again towards the back end of Shuttle 
  (as shown in Fig 7), and the Shuttle is threaded <font color="#CC3333">without</font> 
  having to pass the thread through a <font color="#CC3333">single hole</font> 
  -- in fact, this Shuttle is really, and absolutely,<b> <font color="#CC3333">SELF-THREADING</font>.</b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">-</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#CC3333" size="+1">When the Front Shuttle Cover 
  is withdrawn, be sure you Oil the Cotton in the cup that lubricates the Shuttle 
  and the Shuttle-race. This is important.</font></b></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000"><img src="fig07.jpg" width="192" height="461" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="25">TO 
  REGULATE THE SHUTTLE TENSION</font></h3>
<p align="center">Always use the special small Screw Driver, so as not to damage 
  the Shuttle Tension Screw.</p>
<p align="center">By turning this Screw <font color="#CC3333">to the right</font>, 
  you increase or tighten the Shuttle Tension.By turning this Screw <font color="#CC3333">to 
  the left</font>, you decrease or slacken the Shuttle Tension.</p>
<p align="center">The Shuttle Tension should never be as tight as the Needle or 
  Top Tension.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">BEFORE COMMENCING TO SEW</font></h3>
<p align="center">Withdraw the Front Slide that covers the Shuttle. Turn the Balance 
  Wheel until the Shuttle Carrier is in the position for you to place the Shuttle 
  into the Carrier. <font color="#CC3333">The Balance Wheel should always turn 
  towards you</font>.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO PULL THE SHUTTLE THREAD UP THROUGH 
  THE NEEDLE-PLATE HOLE</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Hold the end of the Needle or Top Thread between the thumb and 
  finger of your left hand, then turn the Balance Wheel <font color="#CC3333">towards 
  you</font>, until the needle moves <font color="#CC3333">down</font> and up 
  again to its <font color="#CC3333">highest point</font>, and you will find the 
  Needle or Top Thread will catch and pull the Shuttle Thread up through the Needle-plate 
  hole.</p>
<p align="center">Now close the Front Slide, place both ends of the threads, also 
  the material to be sewn, under the Presser-Foot; then lower the Presser-Foot, 
  turning the Balance Wheel <font color="#CC3333">towards you</font>, and commence 
  sewing.</p>
<p align="center">In sewing soft, thin fabrics, the Tension should be light and 
  easy; on thick and heavy goods it should be tight.</p>
<p align="center">Insewing seams where strangth is required, the Tension should 
  be alike on both threads, in order that the lock may be in the centre of the 
  goods, thus -----</p>
<p align="center"><img src="thread1.gif" width="201" height="50"></p>
<p align="center">If the lower thread lies straight on the underside of the goods, 
  thus -----</p>
<p align="center"><img src="thread2.gif" width="195" height="54"></p>
<p align="center">the Shuttle Tension is too tight, or the Needle or Top Tension 
  too loose.</p>
<p align="center">If the upper thread lies straight, the Needle or Top Tension 
  is too tight, or the Shuttle Tension too loose.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="thread3.gif" width="188" height="52"></p>
<p align="center">In stitching goods which are too thin to conceal the lock of 
  the threads in the centre, the lock may be thrown in the direction of what is 
  to be the &quot;wrong &quot; side of the finished work so as to present a better 
  appearance on the &quot;right&quot; side.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">WHEN REMOVING THE WORK</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Always have the Needle Bar at its highest point. With the forefinger 
  of the right hand, lift the Presser-Bar, and at the same time <font color="#CC3333">press 
  with the thumb</font> upon the Tension Releaser (Fig 4); this liberates or slackens 
  the thread in the Tension, and you can easily draw the work from under the Presser-Foot 
  without any fear of bending the Needle or breaking the threads. Then cut the 
  threads, <font color="#CC3333">leaving the ends long enough</font> to recommence 
  sewing.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO ALTER THE LENGTH OF STITCH</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">(<i>See Stitch Handle close to Balance Wheel, Fig 5</i>)</p>
<p align="center">By lifting this Handle <font color="#CC3333">upwards</font>, 
  you make the stitch longer.</p>
<p align="center">By pulling the Handle <font color="#CC3333">down</font>, you 
  make the stitch shorter.</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#CC3333" size="+1">CAUTION</font> -- If you pull 
  this Handle down as far as it will go, the machine will not feed or carry the 
  work forward at all.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">TO ALTER THE PRESSURE ON PRESSER-FOOT</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">(<i>So as to put more pressure on the material</i>)</p>
<p align="center">Turn the Milled-Head Presser-Foot Adjusting Screw (Fig 4) at 
  the top of the Presser-Bar to the <font color="#CC3333">right</font>, to increase 
  the pressure; or to the <font color="#CC3333">left</font>, to decrease the pressure. 
  For ordinary domestic sewing it is very seldom necessary to alter the pressure 
  on Presser-Foot, but on thin soft fabrics the pressure should be light, on thick 
  materials it should be heavier.</p>
<p align="center"><b>******************************************</b></p>
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">SPECIAL NOTES</font></b></h3>
<p align="center">Be sure and take particular notice that the Balance Wheel must 
  turn towards you.</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000" size="+1">Sharp pointed Needles</font>. 
  It is of the utmost importance that the Needle has a good sharp point.</p>
<p align="center">If the Needle thread breaks when the Needle is adjusted properly 
  it is caused by the Top Tension being <font color="#CC3333">too tight</font>, 
  or the eye of the Needle being <font color="#CC3333">too small for the thread</font>, 
  or the eye of the Needle being rough or sharp; or the Shuttle, or Shuttle Carrier, 
  being rough or damaged.</p>
<p align="center">If the Shuttle Thread breaks, slacken the Shuttle Tension, by 
  unscrewing the small Shuttle Tension Screw at the point of the Shuttle.</p>
<p align="center">The Needle must be pushed up the hole in the Needle Bar as far 
  as ever it will go, and then it is sure to be in the right place.</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000" size="+1">Missed Stitches</font> are caused 
  by the Needle being bent away from the Shuttle, or by a crooked Needle, or if 
  the Needle Eye is too large for the thread.</p>
<p align="center">If the thread is improperly or too tightly twisted, it may throw 
  the loop towards one side, instead of throwing the loop square into the Shuttle-race. 
  In that case the Needle should be slightly turned in an opposite direction to 
  counteract this tendency to throw the loop away from its proper position.</p>
<p align="center">Always use the best soft finished cotton, because it makes better 
  work and is the cheapest in the end.</p>
