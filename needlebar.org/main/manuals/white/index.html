<h4 align="center"><b><i>Never run Machine with needle threaded without goods 
  under presser foot. Run Machine so that upper side of hand wheel moves from 
  you.</i></b></h4>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">TO SET NEEDLE</font></h3>
<p align="left">Raise the needle-bar to its highest point; loosen the thumbscrew 
  and press it to the left to permit the shank of the <font color="#CC3333">NEEDLE</font> 
  to pass up between the clamp and needle-bar as far as it will go, flat side 
  to the <font color="#CC3333">RIGHT</font> -- the <font color="#CC3333">NEEDLE</font> 
  being flattened on one side so it will set itself perfectly, then fasten securely 
  by tightening thumb-screw.</p>
<p align="left"><i>To avoid loosening of the needle, always use a screw driver 
  to fasten the same, the needle nut being slotted for that purpose.</i></p>
<p align="left">The needle, when descending, should pass <font color="#CC3333">CENTRAL</font> 
  in the needle hole from <font color="#CC3333">FRONT TO REAR</font>, but close 
  to the right side of the hole, as it prevents the needle from glancing into 
  the race and being caught by the shuttle.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">NEEDLES AND THREAD TO BE USED</font></h3>
<p align="left">The MOST IMPORTANT consideration is to buy and use perfect needles 
  -- not bent, nor blunt points. <i>We particularly request our dealers and their 
  customers to buy their needles and oil from us. WHITE F. R. NEEDLES must be 
  used on this machine.</i></p>
<p align="left">The size of he needle should conform to the size of the thread 
  and both be suitable to the material sewed. Use as fine a needle as will permit 
  the thread to pass freely through the eye.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="01.jpg" width="550" height="576"></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000"><img src="01.gif" width="315" height="240" align="left" hspace="10"><font color="#CC0000">TO 
  REMOVE BOBBIN CASE FROM SHUTTLE</font></font></h3>
<p align="left">Raise the take-up to its highest point. With the thumb and second 
  finger of the left hand clasp bobbin case as shown in cut, then lift latch <font color="#CC3333">S</font> 
  with the third finger, when bobbin case may be readily withdrawn from shuttle 
  <font color="#CC3333">F</font>. See below</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">TO REMOVE SHUTTLE FROM SHUTTLE RACE</font></h3>
<p align="left">First remove the bobbin case. Turn the machine back on its hinges, 
  then turn the machine in the same direction as in sewing until the point of 
  the needle just enters the needle plate hole; push on rear end of latch <font color="#CC3333">G</font> 
  and at the same time pull shuttle race cover away from shuttle and toward latch 
  <font color="#CC3333">G</font> from under pin <font color="#CC3333">H</font>; 
  the shuttle can now be removed.</p>
<p align="left">When shuttle has been removed from race be sure to clean both, 
  and oil the race slightly before replacing. Occasionally oil slightly in hole 
  on race cap marked <font color="#CC3333">V</font> above and pin <font color="#CC3333">W</font> 
  in shuttle, see fig 9.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">TO REPLACE THE SHUTTLE</font></h3>
<p align="left">Turn the machine in direction for sewing until the point of the 
  needle just enters the needle plate hole; take the shuttle by the center pin 
  W with the left hand and place it in the race, so that point of shuttle will 
  be from you and <img src="07.gif" width="185" height="222" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">over 
  arrow on thread cast of, so that the holes in the shuttle will drop on to driving 
  pins in race, then replace the shuttle race cover.</p>
<p align="left">DO NOT FORCE the shuttle into race. It will enter readily when 
  in proper position.</p>
<p align="left">Should the machine at any time time act badly in sewing or running 
  it would be well to remove shuttle and clean it and the race, which is but a 
  moment's work.</p>
<p align="left">To replace the bobbin case, it need not be held as when removing, 
  but simply slip it on the pin in shuttle, with the tension projecting upward, 
  and push it into shuttle as far as it will go, when the spring latch will pass 
  over and retain it in that position.</p>
<p align="left">The thread should be allowed to project about one inch from bobbin 
  case tension.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">TO WIND BOBBIN</font></h3>
<p align="left"><b><img src="08.gif" width="190" height="255" align="left" hspace="10"></b>Place 
  spool on spool pin, pass the thread down through the rear hole in arm of cover 
  plate, then to the left under and over the arm down through front hole. Put 
  the end of thread through hole <font color="#CC3333">U</font> in bobbin from 
  inside out, place bobbin on bobbin wider spindle, raise winder so belt will 
  drive it, loosen thumb screw in hand wheel, run the machine as in sewing, holding 
  on to the end of thread until winding is started, then break off thread and 
  finish winding.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">LOWER TENSION</font></h3>
<p align="left">Fig. 8 represents the bobbin case. To regulate the lower tension, 
  turn the screw T to the right to tighten, and to the left to loosen the same.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">TO THREAD BOBBIN CASE TENSION</font></h3>
<p align="left">Place bobbin in case so that thread will come from bobbin on same 
  side as hole <font color="#CC3333">B</font> in bobbin case; pass thread through 
  slot <font color="#CC3333">A</font> to hole <font color="#CC3333">B</font> thence 
  across opening, drawing it under lip <font color="#CC3333">C</font> then pull 
  it up until thread passes out under tension spring <font color="#CC3333">D</font>.</p>
<p align="left">The tension on bobbin case should be the same as the upper tension. 
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="09.gif" width="299" height="273" align="left"><img src="10.gif" width="400" height="300"></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">DIRECTIONS FOR THREADING</font></h3>
<p align="left">Place the spool on spool pin, take the thread in your left hand 
  holding it taut with the right during the whole <img src="11.gif" width="282" height="675" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="15">threading 
  operation. Pass thread from spool over check spring K at top of face and down 
  under point L. </p>
<p align="left">Now pull thread upward until it passes through the eye of spring 
  N and into notch O, then into end of take-up P then down through slot R in end 
  of needle bar and through eye of needle from left to right, allowing about 3 
  inches of thread when take-up is at its highest point.</p>
<p align="left"><i>To draw up the lower thread</i>, raise the presser-foot, take 
  hold of end of upper thread and turn the hand wheel once round, (moving upper 
  side of wheel from you), which will draw the lower thread up through needle 
  hole.</p>
<p align="left">Pass the ends of both threads under the presser-foot and you will 
  be ready to sew.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Note, -- </i>Do not run the machine with the presser-foot down 
  on the feed without cloth under it. Do not pull cloth to or from you in such 
  a manner as to bend the needle.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">THE TENSION</font></h3>
<p align="left">The illustration above represents the Tension Regulator and Indicator 
  for the upper thread, an entirely new and useful device.</p>
<p align="left">The half circle is marked with a scale running from 1 to 8, with 
  the word &quot;loose&quot; at Number 1 and &quot;tight&quot; at Number 8 , Number 
  1 being the slack and Number 8 the tightest tension.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">TO CHANGE THE LENGTH OF STITCH</font></h3>
<p align="left">The regulator is located at the right end of the machine on the 
  front side or arm. </p>
<p align="left">TO SHORTEN stitch move lever down.</p>
<p align="left">TO LENGTHEN stitch move lever up. Number 1 indicates the shortest, 
  and Number 7 the longest stitch</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">OIL PLACES AS INDICATED BELOW</font></h3>
<h3 align="center"><img src="12.gif" width="509" height="446"></h3>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">TO REGULATE THE TENSION</font></h3>
<p align="left">To loosen the tension, turn the thumbscrew on the dial to the 
  left which will move the pointer towards No. 1. To tighten it, turn to the right, 
  moving the pointer towards No. 8.</p>
<p align="left">By this means the same tension can always be duplicated, thus 
  obviating the necessity of experimental trials, as is the case with other machines. 
  If a tight tension is desired, both upper and under threads must necessarily 
  be tight.</p>
<p align="left">If the upper thread is tight and the lower thread loose, the upper 
  thread will be drawn to the top thus:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="13.gif" width="224" height="64"></p>
<p align="left">If the lower thread is too tight, it will be drawn straight on 
  the bottom of the goods, thus:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="14.gif" width="226" height="65"></p>
<p align="left">When you desire the goods to look alike on both sides, and be 
  elastic, balance the tension thus:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="15.gif" width="244" height="65"></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">THE TENSION RELEASER</font></h3>
<p align="left">The tension releaser is operated by the presser-bar lifter. By 
  means of it, all tension is taken off the upper thread when the presser-foot 
  is raised, and the work can be taken out without pulling the thread down by 
  hand.</p>
<p align="left">***<i>PARTICULAR NOTICE </i>--- <i>The tension cannot be regulated 
  when the lift is up because the Releaser is operated by the presser-bar lifter.</i></p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">TO COMMENCE WORK</font></h3>
<p align="left">In threading the needle and bobbin case respectively, you should 
  leave an end about two inches in length to each. Hold the end of the upper thread 
  loosely in the left hand, and with the right hand gently revolve the hand-wheel 
  until the needle passes to its lowest point and returns, a loop will be formed 
  through which the shuttle will pass, and, as the needle ascends it will draw 
  up the lower or shuttle thread, and the machine is ready for practical operation.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">TO REMOVE WORK</font></h3>
<p align="left">Stop the machine with the take-up at its highest point; raise 
  the presser-foot with the lifter which slackens the upper thread; then take 
  hold of your work with your left hand and pull it directly from you, keeping 
  the top thread in the slot of the presser-foot, which will prevent bending the 
  needle.</p>
<p align="left">Now raise the work and draw the threads into the thread cutter 
  on the presser-bar and pull downward, which will cut the threads the proper 
  length to commence work again.</p>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC0000">EXPLANATION OF DIFFICULTIES THAT SOMETIMES 
  OCCUR WITH BEGINNERS</font></h3>
<p align="left"><i>If the upper thread breaks, </i>it may be caused by the needle 
  not being properly set, or the machine not threaded correctly, or the upper 
  tension too tight, or the thread uneven and the needle too small for it, or 
  the needle eye too sharp, or the presser-foot attached to the machine so that 
  the needle rubs it in passing.</p>
<p align="left"><i>If the under thread breaks, </i>it may be caused by the bobbin 
  case being improperly threaded, or too much tension upon it, or by the bobbin 
  being wound too full so that the thread slips over the ends of the bobbin in 
  the bobbin case.</p>
<p align="left"><i>If the needle breaks, </i>it is more than likely your own fault, 
  caused by pulling the goods to or from you in such a manner that the needle 
  strikes the throat plate and is bound to break. The needle may however, break 
  in trying to sew extraordinary heavy seams when the pressure on the presser-foot 
  is not heavy enough. To create more pressure upon the goods turn the presser-bar 
  nut on top of the presser-bar to the right; to decrease the pressure turn it 
  to the left.</p>
<p align="left"><i>If the machine makes loop stitches, </i>it is most sure to 
  be caused by too loose tension both top and bottom.</p>
<p align="left"><i>If the machine skips stitches, </i>the needle is either bent 
  or not in the right position.</p>
<p align="left"><i>If the stitches are not even, </i>it may be caused by the presser-foot 
  not resting evenly upon the fabric sewed, or by the feed not being high enough, 
  or by the stitch being too short, or by pulling the cloth, or by using too fine 
  a needle with too coarse or uneven thread.</p>
<p align="left">If the machine should be run without sewing and thread get in 
  the shuttle race making the <i>machine run heavy,</i> take out the bobbin case 
  and run the machine in the wrong direction; it will cut the thread out.</p>
<p align="left"><i>NOTICE --- </i>The leather band should always be tight enough 
  not to slip. If it slips, or does not force the needle through thick goods, 
  cut off a very short piece and re-adjust the ends. The belt should not be so 
  tight as to prevent and easy motion of the machine.</p>
