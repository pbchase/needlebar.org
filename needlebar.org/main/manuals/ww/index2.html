<hr>
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">GENERAL DIRECTIONS</font></h3>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To Turn a Corner -- Stop the machine with 
  the needle in the cloth, after it has been down and come partly up. Then lift 
  the presser-foot, and turn the work in the manner desired, using the needle 
  as a pivot.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To Swing the Presser-foot out of the way 
  -- for any purpose, turn the machine to raise the needle to its highest pint, 
  raise the presser with the thumb and finger, and turn it around to the right.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Needles may be Sharpened -- on the emery 
  wheel by placing it on the spooler-spindle. Grind the point long and tapering.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The Belt -- should be only tight enough 
  to move the machine without slipping. Should it become too loose, a piece must 
  be cut out near the belt hook, and another hole made and hooked again.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">For ordinary purposes the belt should 
  pass around the smaller part of the band wheel and the larger part of the balance 
  wheel. To obtain more power for heavy work, or to have the machine run easier, 
  place the belt in the other groove of both wheels.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To Clean the Machine -- Remove the front 
  and back plate slides, throat-plate, and the bobbin-holder, and wipe off all 
  the parts; particularly about the needle-bar, rotating hook, and feed. In replacing 
  the bobbin-holder, be sure and push it as far to the right as it will go, and 
  turn the screw down tightly with the screw-driver. After cleaning, oil as before 
  directly.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">If the machine has been neglected and 
  has become gummed, use kerosene oil or turpentine, and wipe thoroughly to remove 
  all old oil and dirt, after which use sewing machine oil as usual.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Causes of the Machine not working properly 
  -- will usually be found in the tension not being properly adjusted, the thread 
  being too coarse for the needle, the needle and thread too coarse for the throat-plate, 
  or in the needle being bent, blunted, or imperfectly set. See that the needle 
  is pushed up as far as it will go into the needle-bar, and that it goes perfectly 
  true through the hole in the throat-plate. If it does not, spring the point 
  in the requisite direction, till it goes all the way alike.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">If the machine misses stitches when using 
  hard twisted cotton thread, loosen the set screw and turn the long groove of 
  the needle slightly towards you (to throw the loop more directly in front of 
  the rotating hook).</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Do not let the thread check, or the groove 
  in the tension-pulley become clogged with lint, dirt, or knots of thread.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">In using fine silk, should it slip around 
  the tension-pulley without turning it, wind it twice or more times around the 
  pulley.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Do not let the guide-roller, or the roller 
  in the upper end of the take-up, become clogged, but frequently oil the screws 
  on which they turn, so that they may turn freely.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To adjust the Feed -- Should the feed-bar 
  be worn down by long use, it may be raised by turning the middle screw in the 
  feed point, with the screw-driver on the small steel wrench. Turning to the 
  right will raise, and to the left will lower the point.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">It should never rise more than one thirty-second 
  of an inch above the plate, or enough to raise the hemmer slightly.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The feed is always adjusted properly when 
  the machine leaves the office.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><img src="06.jpg" width="659" height="193"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><i>The Plain Glass </i>is for all ordinary 
  sewing and stitching.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><i>The Side-Cut Glass </i>is for stitching 
  close to, and parallel with very thick seams, and also to be used with the plate 
  gauge, for narrow tucking, etc., where it is desirable to place the gauge very 
  near the needle.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><i>To Cord with the Corder Glass --</i> 
  Insert the corder glass into the presser-foot. Place the cord between the cloth 
  where you desire to stitch it, and crowd it into its place as close as possible 
  with the point of the scissors or some similar instrument, by rubbing it along 
  near the cord on top of the cloth. Place the work under the presser-foot, with 
  the cord in the crease in the bottom of the glass, and stitch as usual.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To Gather -- Insert the gathering glass 
  into the presser-foot; use for the upper thread a much larger one than usual, 
  say No. 36 for ordinary muslin, while you use the ordinary size, say 70, below. 
  Make the tension of the upper thread tight, and that of the under thread as 
  loose as possible; stitch the cloth where it is to be gathered, regulating the 
  fulness by means of the feed; the longer the stitch the greater will be the 
  fulness. If the fulness is too great even with the shortest stitch, reduce the 
  upper tension. If desirable in any case sew with threads as above, with the 
  upper tension only tight enough to gather the work slightly, and finish by drawing 
  up the upper thread by hand.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><img src="07.jpg" width="637" height="371"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To Braid -- Insert the braider glass in 
  the presser-foot, pass the braid through the extra hole and under the needle, 
  so that it may pass through it, and stitch the fabric where you wish to lay 
  the braid. By having a pattern first stamped or marked upon the goods, the braid 
  may be stitched on in beautiful designs.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><img src="08.jpg" width="649" height="334"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To Hem -- Insert the hemmer in place of 
  the glass. Roll the corner of the cloth slightly, enter it into the scroll of 
  the hemmer, and draw it along to the needle, and proceed to stitch as usual, 
  and the hemmer will turn the hem; keep the edge of the cloth in the hemmer only 
  far enough to surround the tongue within the scroll, as if too much or too little 
  is kept in the hemmer it will leave a raw edge. If the seam is not on the edge 
  of the hem, it is probably because the needle is bent, in which case spring 
  it till it is perfectly true. If it does not then strike the hem right, it is 
  because the presser-bar has been turned, in which case loosen the screw which 
  holds the bar from turning, and move the hemmer slightly in the direction required, 
  and tighten the screw again firmly.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">The hemmer is always in proper position 
  when sent out, so that the needle will strike the hem in the proper place; and 
  the bar should not be moved unless rendered necessary by accident.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To make a wide hem, fold the cloth over 
  to the width of the hem desired, crease it down smoothly, and pass the edge 
  <img src="09.jpg" width="152" height="152" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="10">through 
  the hemmer, which will turn the edge under while it is being stitched down.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To Fell with the Hemmer -- First seam 
  up the two edges, one a little wider than the other; a good rule for getting 
  them of the proper width is to keep the edge of the upper piece of cloth under 
  the notch in the end of the hemmer, and let the under piece project beyond the 
  upper as far as the side of the hemmer. Then open the cloth and pass it under 
  the presser-foot, allowing the raw edge to pass through the hemmer, which will 
  turn it under as in hemming. Nearly the whole secret in felling is in getting 
  the edges the proper width in sewing the first seam.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><img src="10.jpg" width="390" height="376" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="10">The 
  Plate Gauge -- is attached to the plate by means of the extra thumb-screw, and 
  is used for stitching at a regular distance from an edge.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To Quilt -- Attach the quilting gauge 
  to the presser-foot, as seen in the cut, and adjust it to the width desired.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">Let the finger of the gauge rest upon 
  the cloth-plate for a guide while stitching the first seam, then raise the finger 
  enough to let the quilt pass under without touching, and keep the seam last 
  stitched directly under the finger, to insure the seams being equal distances 
  apart.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000">To Stitch Shirt Bosoms -- Set the gauge 
  as far from the needle as you wish to have the stitching from the edge of the 
  fold or plait, and guide the work so that the edge of the plait will follow 
  the gauge.</font></p>
