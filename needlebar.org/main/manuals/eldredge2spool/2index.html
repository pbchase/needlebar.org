	thread from the spool under the hook and down between the discs &quot;B&quot;, 
	passing the thread on side toward you between the discs. Be careful not to 
	wrap it around them. From point &quot;B&quot;, carry the thread straight down 
	and once around the tension pulley &quot;C&quot;, then down under the auxiliary 
	hook and spring &quot;D &amp; E&quot;. Then up through the take-up &quot;F&quot;, 
	(threading from the front) down through the thread guide &quot;G&quot;. (There 
	is an opening in the guide &quot;G&quot; at left side to allow thread to enter

		  possibly slightly <i>more</i> or <i>less</i>, depending on how the case

  <p><font size="4" color="#CC0000"><b>TO THOROUGHLY CLEAN THE MACHINE</b></font></p>
  <p>Granting that the machine has been kept thoroughly well oiled and clean, 
	it may still occur, if the oil is poor or if the machine is allowed to stand 
	a long time without using, that the oil may dry out of the bearings or get 
	thick and gummy, which will cause the machine to run hard and may seriously 
	injure the bearings. When a machine is in this condition, before applying 
	fresh oil, it is well to apply kerosene to all of the bearings very liberally, 
	meanwhile running the machine slowly by hand to move the working parts. Apply 
	kerosene at intervals every few moments, until every bearing has been thoroughly 
	flooded and all of the residue from dry or thick gummy oil, has been thoroughly 
	dissolved and washed out. Then run the machine slowly a few minutes to allow 
	the kerosene to work out of the bearings, after which, wipe the machine dry 
	and free from all kerosene and apply fresh machine oil. By following these 
	instructions carefully, the machine will always run light and free.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="4" color="#CC0000"><b>THE AUTOMATIC TENSION</b></font></p>
  <p>The Automatic Tension is a most important feature of this machine, as it 
	is entirely self-acting, requiring no attention or adjustment by the operator, 
	regardless of the nature of the fabric or of the size or kind of thread used. 
	This machine, before leaving the factory, is tested on a very wide range of 
	thread and fabric and under all ordinary conditions of family sewing. Absolutely 
	no adjustment of the tensions is required for this work.</p>
  <p>If for manufacturing or special work of any kind, it is desirable to alter 
	the tensions, the upper tension can be adjusted in the following manner: - 
	Turn the knurled thumb piece on the tension disc &quot;T&quot;, (figure 6, 
	page 6) toward you to tighten the tension, or to the left, or from you, to 
	decrease the tension.</p>
  <p>Tension on the spool case can also be adjusted, but rarely, if ever, is this 
	necessary. To change this tension, turn the screw No. 4 (figure 10), page 
	8) to the right to increase, or to the left to decrease tension.</p>
  <p>When the tensions are properly adjusted the stitch should lock in center 
	of goods thus:</p>
  <p><img src="tension1.jpg" width="291" height="43"></p>
  <p>When upper tension is too tight, the <i>upper</i> thread will lay flat on 
	<i>upper</i> side of goods and stitch appear thus:</p>
  <p><img src="tension2.jpg" width="291" height="43"></p>
  <p align="center">When upper tension is too loose, the lower thread will lay 
	flat on <i>under</i> side of goods and stitch appear thus:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tension3.jpg" width="291" height="43"></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="4" color="#CC0000"><b>THE STITCH REGULATOR</b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="fig12.jpg" width="397" height="309"></p>
  <p align="center">The numbers on the index plate from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;0&quot; 
	indicate long and short stitches. By removing the stitch regulator from you 
	to No. 1, the machine will sew five stitches to the inch, while at No. 0 it 
	will sew thirty-five stitches to the inch. This is a wider range than on any 
	other machine. You may sew any desired length stitch by moving this switch 
	regulator to the point on scale to suit requirements. The regulator <i>automatically</i> 
	locks itself at all points.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="4" color="#CC0000"><b> WINDING THREAD ON AN ORDINARY 
	SPOOL</b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="fig13.jpg" width="271" height="400"></p>
  <p align="center">One of the principal features of this machine is the savings 
	of winding bobbins as on other machines. It may happen that you will have 
	only one spool or part of a spool of thread available. In that case, take 
	an empty spool that will fit into the spool case (size 50 spool or smaller) 
	and wind onto it by means of the Automatic Spool Winder, the quantity of thread 
	you may desire to use. Before starting to wind thread, release the hand wheel, 
	by turning the knurled thumb piece (letter &quot;1&quot;, figure 13) one half 
	turn toward you. This throws the machine out of gear. Then place full spool 
	on spool pin, as illustrated. Next take the empty spool in the left hand and 
	with the right hand, wrap a few strands of the thread around this spool. Then 
	place spool on the spindle of the spool winder, using care that the thread 
	runs the <i>under side</i> of the spool, as illustrated. Raise the spool winder 
	until the pulley comes in contact with the belt, then start the treadle and 
	proceed to wind spool. If you wish to sew with thread that is coarser than 
	No. 50, you can easily do so by winding the same onto an empty No. 50 spool, 
	following instructions as given above.</p>
