  <p align="center"><font size="4" color="#CC0000"><b>INSTRUCTIONS FOR EMBROIDERING</b></font></p>
  <p align="center">Initial or pennant work may be made by using full sized wool 
	zephyr yarn or three or four colors of darning cotton, in place of the lower 
	thread, (upper thread &auml;s usual). In order to do this work without changing 
	either tension of the machine, we recommend winding the yarn on a No. 50 empty 
	spool. Place this spool on the spool winder and wind the yarn on the spool 
	in accordance with instructions on page 11. To thread the spool case with 
	this zephyr yarn, take the case in the left hand and the spool in the right 
	hand. Insert the end of the yarn outward from the inside of case through the 
	slot, across the outside of case and over (not under) the tension spring, 
	then downward from the outside of the case through the hole, and bring this 
	end out again from the inside of the case through the hole, leaving about 
	three inches of thread projecting that the upper thread can pick it up. (<i>Important. 
	Do not place spool in case until you have threaded case as above instructed.</i>) 
	Be sure that the yarn is on the <i>outer side</i> of tension spring. If there 
	is any slack yarn, it should be wound up on the spool. Then put spool in case, 
	using care to see that none of this yarn is wrapped around the spindle, in 
	the center of the spool case, onto which the spool slips. You may now proceed 
	to embroider, the same &auml;s in doing regular sewing, setting the stitch 
	regulator for any length stitch to suit the class of work desired. The letters 
	or patterns should be stamped with a tracing wheel on the wrong side of the 
	goods, which, in doing this work, is the upper side of the goods, the design 
	in yarn appearing on the under side, as the machine operates.</p>
  <p>The above instructions apply when using smaller yarns. When using heavier 
	yarns thread to No. 6 only, omitting No! l and No. 5.<br>

  <p><font color="#CC0000"><b><font size="4">TO CHANGE THE SELF-SETTING NEEDLE</font></b></font></p>
  <p>TO REMOVE the needle, raise the needle bar to its highest point, loosen the 
	needle clamp screw by a slight turn toward you and slip the needle down until 
	it is free.</p>
  <p>To set the needle, take it in the left hand, placing the point through the 
	hole in the needle plate and then pass the needle up into the bar. In doing 
	this, be sure that the needle is pushed up as far &auml;s it will go and that 
	the long groove of the needle is on the left side and the short groove and 
	flattened shank are to the right.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">THE PRESSER FOOT</font></b></p>
  <p>THE pressure of the foot, as the machine is sent out from the factory, is 
	correct for ordinary sewing, but can be graduated by the presser bar screw, 
	(see No. 2, figure l, page 2) turning this presser bar screw to the right 
	or downward, for more pressure, or to the left or upward for less pressure. 
	The pressure on this foot, as the machine is sent out from the factory, will 
	not need changing, even for very light work. It may be necessary to increase 
	the pressure for extraordinarily heavy work. If the pressure is too heavy 
	when sewing thin goods, the feed will cut the goods.</p>
  <p>The presser foot must be set so that the needle passes midway between the 
	two prongs. If the foot is set a little to one side or the other, it is likely 
	to push the needle out of its proper place and make it strike the needle plate, 
	thus blunting the needle or cutting the upper thread.</p>
  <p>The presser foot is raised by means of the lever directly back of the face 
	plate. This is called the presser bar lifter and is operated by raising it 
	up to its full height until it slips into place. To lower the presser foot, 
	reverse this action.</p>
  <p>To remove the presser foot, raise the presser bar lifter and loosen the knurled 
	hub nut which holds presser foot in place.</p>
  <p>Avoid pushing and pulling the goods while stitching, particularly the latter. 
	This is usually the cause of broken needles, due to the fact that the operator 
	will grasp the goods after it has passed over the feed and pull it, with the 
	idea of aiding the feed. If the goods stretches or slips a little, it will 
	be apt to carry the needle with it, that is, bend it a trifle out of its proper 
	position, so that it will strike the needle plate and either bend or break. 
	Be particularly careful to avoid either pushing or pulling the goods, as the 
	feed will carry through any class of material without aid.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#CC0000"><b><font size="4">SEWING GUIDE</font></b></font></p>
  <p>WITH each machine is furnished a Sewing Guide, together with thumb screw. 
	This guide is fastened to the bed of the machine by means of the thumb screw, 
	as indicated by letter &quot;S&quot;, (figure l, page 2.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> <b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">REMOVING THE WORK</font></b></p>
  <p>T O REMOVE the work, stop the machine with the needle out of the goods and 
	with the take-up lever at its very highest point. <b>This is Important</b>. 
	Raise the presser foot with the presser bar lifter, located at the back of 
	the face plate. As this is done, the Automatic Tension Release comes into 
	action and releases all tension on the upper thread. Next draw the work backward 
	away from the presser foot. Then bring both threads over from the back and 
	cut them with the blade of the thread cutter which fits into the presser bar.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">THE BELT</font></b></p>
  <p>THIS machine works best with as loose a belt &auml;s can be used without 
	slipping on the belt wheels. If the belt is too loose, disconnect the coupling 
	and cut off a little from one end, say half an inch. The large drive wheel 
	on the stand has a close fitting wheel guard which holds the belt always in 
	position on this wheel. When you desire to turn the sewing head back for oiling 
	or cleaning, simply slip the belt off of the upper pulley on outside of hand 
	wheel.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">SKIPPED STITCHES</font></b></p>
  <p>THESE are sometimes caused by using a needle too small for the thread, using 
	a bent needle, or by the improper setting of the needle. In setting the needle, 
	the long groove must, be turned toward the left, the flat shank toward the 
	right and the needle must be pushed up into the needle bar &auml;s far &auml;s 
	it will go, and secured firmly by the needle clamp.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">BREAKING THE UPPER THREAD</font></b></p>
  <p>THIS may be caused by improper setting of the needle, using a needle with 
	a sharp or imperfect eye, the thread uneven or too large for the needle, the 
	upper tension too tight, or by improper threading of the machine. It is important 
	that the needle pass directly between the prongs of the presser foot and through 
	the hole in the needle plate, without rubbing. If the needle rubs against 
	the presser foot or the sides of the needle plate hole, there is danger of 
	breaking the upper thread.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b><font size="4" color="#CC0000">BREAKING THE LOWER THREAD</font></b></p>
  <p>THIS may be caused by having too much tension on the spool case or through 
	the improper threading of this spool case. It is also possible if the end 
	of thread from the spool case is allowed to be caught in the spool case cover, 
	or if there is any slack thread in the spool case which may become wound around 
	the spindle (letter &quot;K&quot;, figure 10, page 8.)</p>
