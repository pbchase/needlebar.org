<P>Raise presser foot <B>G</B> by means of presser bar lifter <B>J</B> to prevent injury to the foot <B>G</B> and feed <B>H.</B></P>

<P>Place a piece of material under presser foot and let the foot down upon it. Turn on electric current and, if the combination knee and foot controller is installed as a knee controller, press knee lever to the right.</p>
<IMG SRC="fig05.gif" ALT="Figure 5" ALIGN="Left">
<p> If controller is placed on the floor to be used as a foot controller, press down on pedal of controller.</P>


<P>The speed of the machine is controlled entirely by the amount of pressure applied to the controller.</P>
<P>Operate the machine in this way, without being threaded, until you have become accustomed to guiding the material and operating the controller.</P>
<P><B><font color="#660000">IF THE MACHINE IS HAND OPERATED</font></B></P>
<P>When the machine is uncovered, the hand attachment will be gound to be out of working position as shown in <B>Fig 6.</B> Pull the small spring stud <B>2</B>, and trun the handle back until the lever <B>1</B> enters the socket <B>3.</B> Press back the hinged finger <B>4, Fig 7</B> between the spokes of the wheel.

<P>Loosen the hand wheel by turning stop motion screw <B>17, Fig 12, over toward you,</B> place both feet upon the treadle and turn the hand wheel over toward you, at the same time allowing the feet to move freely and lightly with the motion of the treadle.</P>
<P>Continue to do this until a regular and easy movement is acquired and you are able to work the treadle so that you can re-start the machine with the wheel turning toward you.</P>
<P>When familiar with the working movement, tighten the hand wheel by turning the stop motion screw over from you, and place a piece of material under the presser foot <B>G, Fig 5.</B> </p>
<p>Lower the latter by means of the lifter and again work the machine, without being threaded, until you are accustomed to guiding the material.</P>
<P>The belt should be only just tight enough not to slip. If too loose, shorten and rejoin.</P>

<IMG SRC="fig08.gif" ALT="Figure 8" ALIGN="Right">

<P><B><font color="#660000">BELT SHIFTER</font></B></P>
<P>This device simplifies throwing off and replacing the belt. To throw off the belt, move the belt shifter to the left (see <B>Fig 8</B>), working the treadle at the same time. To replace the belt, work the treadle slowly with the band wheel turning toward you, when a revolution or two of the wheel will bring the belt back into its place.</P>
