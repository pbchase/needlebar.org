    <h4><font color="#CC0000">COMMENCING TO SEW</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The machine</font> <font color="#000000">being 
      threaded correctly above and below, as directed, raise the presser bar and 
      raise the needle to its highest point. Place the goods under the presser 
      foot with the needle directly over the point where you wish to begin stitching. 
      Lower the presser foot by the presser bar lifter and start the machine by 
      turning the hand wheel toward you. In sewing heavy or hard fabrics, greater 
      pressure is needed on the presser foot than for light goods. The pressure 
      is regulated by the adjusting nut on top of the presser bar. Turn this nut 
      to the right to increase the pressure, or to the left to decrease it.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">THE TENSIONS</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The object to be attained is to have 
      the stitch alike on both sides of the fabric. This is accomplished by the 
      tensions, or strain upon both threads. The tension upon both threads should 
      be as nearly alike as possible, and tight enough only to make a smooth firm 
      seam. If the threads are of the proper size for the material used, and both 
      tensions right, the threads will be drawn and locked together in the center 
      of the goods, thus:</font></p>
    <p><img src="05.jpg" width="174" height="47"></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">If the upper tension is too loose 
      (or the lower one too tight) the lower thread will lie straight along the 
      under side of the goods, thus:</font></p>
    <p><img src="06.jpg" width="166" height="49"></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">the upper thread showing in loops 
      on the under side. On the contrary, if the upper tension is too tight (or 
      the shuttle tension too loose), the upper thread will lie straight on the 
      upper side of the goods, thus:</font></p>
    <p><img src="07.jpg" width="167" height="46"></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">the lower thread showing in loops 
      on the upper side.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">TO TIGHTEN THE UPPER TENSION turn the tension nut 
      to the RIGHT.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">TO LOOSEN THE UPPER TENSION turn the tension nut 
      to the LEFT.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">As the shuttle tension has been set 
      for general work when the machine leaves our hands, as before explained, 
      any needed regulation of the stitch in this respect, should ordinarily be 
      made by changing the upper tension. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">If, however, when the upper tension 
      is regulated so the lock is in the center of the goods, both threads appear 
      to be loose, and the stitches and seam not smooth and firm, the shuttle 
      tension is too loose, and should be tightened by turning the tension screw 
      to the right; tighten the upper tension accordingly.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">If the under thread cannot be properly 
      drawn up without having the upper tension so tight that the thread breaks, 
      or if, when the tensions are evenly balanced, the goods are &quot;drawn&quot; 
      or &quot;puckered&quot; (this will occur only in sewing very light and &quot;slazy&quot; 
      fabrics) the shuttle tension is too tight and should be loosened by turning 
      the shuttle tension screw to the left; then loosen the upper tension to 
      correspond.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The above particular explanation 
      is given that every operator may fully understand the principles of the 
      tensions.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">TO REMOVE THE WORK FROM THE MACHINE</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Stop the machine with the needle 
      at its highest point, raise the presser foot by means of the lifter at the 
      back, place the right thumb on the tension release lever on front of arm 
      of machine to free the upper thread and with the left hand draw the work 
      out directly back from the needle.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">USE GOOD NEEDLES AND THREAD</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Do not use inferior thread or needles. 
      Any good thread will work well, but you must not expect to make a smooth, 
      even stitch with cheap, rough thread, nor can you expect a machine to work 
      well with an inferior grade of needles, made in imitation of ours. As our 
      interest is to maintain the reputation of the machine, it is evident that 
      we will always supply the best. If you cannot secure the right kind of needles 
      from a dealer in your locality, send to us by mail, enclosing a money order 
      or stamps sufficient to cover the cost and we will fill the order promptly 
      by mail or express. When ordering, state sizes or needles desired, and give 
      the plate number of your machine which you will find on the front shuttle 
      race slide, directly in front of the needle.</font></p>

    <h4><font color="#CC0000">TO REMOVE THE PRESSER FOOT</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Raise the presser foot to its highest 
      point, unscrew the nut just above the presser foot by turning to the left, 
      until the foot is loosened, when it can be drawn off towards you.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">NARROW HEMMING</font></h4>
    <p><b><img src="08.jpg" width="700" height="592"></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Attach the hemmer foot in place of 
      the presser foot, taking care that it stands true, and straight with the 
      feed. Raise the hemmer by means of the lifter, clip off the right hand corner 
      of the cloth, and turn up the edge about one-fourth of an inch. Insert it 
      in its scroll (or mouth) of the hemmer, and push it forward to the needle. 
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Then let the hemmer down and start 
      the machine, gently holding back on the work to keep it smooth, allowing 
      the edge of the goods to pass between the thumb and forefinger of the right 
      hand while it is being hemmed, keeping the scroll of the hemmer just full, 
      as it will leave a raw edge and make a rough and clumsy hem if there is 
      too much turned in, and too little will not turn under. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">In hemming a curve, flannel or slazy 
      goods, draw gently on the edge being hemmed, resisting the feed, and guide 
      the work carefully.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The stitch may be laid close to the 
      edge of the hem, or away from it by setting the hemmer to or from the needle, 
      by swinging the hemmer to the right or left. Practice is necessary with 
      both hemming and felling before a neat seam can be produced.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">FELLING</font></h4>
    <p><b><img src="09.jpg" width="700" height="546"></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The foot hemmer and feller is attached 
      in place of the regular presser foot as shown above, and is the same attachment 
      used for narrow hemming as described. If the hemmer and feller is attached 
      it can be used in the place of the presser foot in running up the seam, 
      the under edge of which should project about one-fourth of an inch beyond 
      the upper, then trim off the edges, if necessary, so as to leave just seam 
      enough to fill the feller. Open the work flat, wrong side up, and trim the 
      corner of the seam slightly, and then push it in to the feller until it 
      reaches the needle, lower the feller on the feed and start the machine. 
      The feed will carry the seam without helping it, and makes a complete fell 
      from the beginning.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The feller may be adjusted to the 
      right or left, so as to sew close on the edge of the fell, or away from 
      it as desired.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The illustration above shows a completed 
      felled seam in the middle of the work.</font></p>

    <h4><font color="#CC0000">MAKING WIDE HEM WITH HEMMER AND FELLER</font></h4>
    <p><img src="10.jpg" width="663" height="518"></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">If a wider hem is desired than can 
      be made with any of the hemmers, proceed as follows:</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Adjust the hemmer and feller as described.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Fold the cloth the width of the hem 
      desired and place the fold to the right of the needle so that the edge of 
      the folded part will easily enter the scroll of the hemmer and feller. Proceed 
      as in ordinary narrow hemming, as described, taking care to keep the fold 
      smooth by holding the edge of the fold between the thumb and fingers of 
      the right hand.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">WIDE HEMMING</font></h4>
    <p><b><img src="11.jpg" width="717" height="577"></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Four widths of hemmers accompany 
      each machine.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Fold the goods by hand the width 
      of hem required, turning one fold only, adding about one-eighth of an inch, 
      which will be turned under by the hemmer. Then insert the goods in the hemmer, 
      forcing it back until the needle will catch the edge of the goods. Lower 
      the presser foot and sew as usual. Slightly press on the goods with the 
      two forefingers of the left hand. If more goods is required to fill the 
      hemmer and turn the edge properly, slightly carry the goods to the right. 
      If too much goods is taken, carry to the left.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The line of stitching can be adjusted 
      to the edge of the hem by moving the hemmer to the right or left.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">TUCKING</font></h4>
    <p><b><img src="12.jpg" width="700" height="536"></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Raise the presser bar to its highest 
      point. Remove the presser foot and attach the tucker in its place so that 
      the needle passes down through the center of the round hole in the foot 
      of the tucker, then fasten it securely in this position.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">To regulate the size of tuck, loosen 
      the thumb screw on top of tucker and place the gauge for any desired width, 
      moving to the right for wide space and to the left for narrow tuck.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">To regulate the space between tucks, 
      move the marker to the left for wide space and to the right for narrow.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The figures on the scale on the back 
      side of the tucker show the width of tuck, and those on the scale in front 
      show the width of space.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">By adjusting the two gauges so that 
      the scale indicators will point to the same figures it will make the tucks 
      just meet. When the above adjustments have been made, be sure and turn screw 
      down tight.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">TO COMMENCE TUCKING - Fold the cloth 
      for the first tuck and place it beneath and under the spring lip in front 
      of the creaser with folded edge against the gauge. Drop the presser foot 
      and sew as usual.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The marker makes a crease in the 
      cloth as it passes over the blade; after the first tuck is completed, fold 
      the cloth on the crease for the required number of tucks.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">BIAS BINDING</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Remove the presser foot and attach 
      the bias binder in its place. The small end of the scroll of the binder 
      should rest on the needle plate, with the upper scroll of the binder on 
      a line with the needle.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Pass the binding through the scroll 
      of the binder and draw it back under the needle. Place the edge of the material 
      to be bound between the upper and lower scrolls, then lower the presser 
      bar and sew as usual. Guide the cloth with the left hand, and let the binding 
      glide easily through the fingers of the right hand to keep it straight. 
      If the stitching should be too near or too far from the edge of the binding, 
      the binder can be moved to the right or left, until exactly right. For bias 
      binding, goods of any description can be used, and the binding should be 
      cut seven-eighths of an inch wide, and uniform in width.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">To turn a square corner when binding, 
      stop the machine at the corner, with the needle in the goods, raise the 
      presser foot and turn the work on the needle. Then before starting the machine 
      tuck in the folds of the binding, using the small screw driver for that 
      purpose.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">TO MAKE FRENCH FOLDS</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Pass the binding through the binder 
      and sew as usual, stitching the edges together. A double French fold may 
      be made by folding a narrow strip of cloth and passing the raw edges through 
      the scroll of the binder.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">TO USE THE UNDER BRAIDER</font></h4>
    <p><b><img src="13.jpg" width="700" height="687"></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Remove the front race cover and slide 
      the braider in its place, as shown above. Take off the regular presser foot 
      and put on the special foot with two short prongs. Draw the braid through 
      the braider tube, as shown in cut, raise the presser foot, and see that 
      the needle passes through the center of the braid. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Use a No. 4 needle, and about 16 
      length of stitch. The pattern should be marked or stamped on the wrong side 
      of the material. Place the goods on the braider and under the presser foot 
      with the pattern side up and with the point where the braiding should begin 
      directly under the needle. Lower the presser foot and sew as usual following 
      the pattern.</font> </p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">DIRECTIONS FOR USING RUFFLER</font></h4>
    <p><b><img src="14.jpg" width="700" height="580"></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Remove the presser foot and attach 
      the ruffler in its place on the presser bar with the fork of the lever over 
      the needle nut &quot;A&quot;. Place the goods to be gathered between the 
      steel blades or springs. If the ruffle is to be attached to a band, place 
      the band below the lower blade.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">To make a fine gather, shorten the 
      stitch and turn the adjusting nut &quot;B&quot; to its highest point.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">To make plaits, turn the adjusting 
      nut &quot;B&quot; downward to the desired point and lengthen the stitch.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">For full gathers, adjust the ruffler 
      the same as in making plaits, using a short stitch.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The length of the stitch should match 
      the size of the gather or plait, so the folds will lie even and not pile 
      up on each other or be too far apart.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">For shirring, remove the lower blade 
      and put to the shirring slide in its place, pushing it in as far as it will 
      go.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Never use the ruffler without either 
      the ruffler or shirring plate in place. Never run the machine with the ruffler 
      on without goods between the steel blades, as the movement of the teeth 
      on the upper blade against the lower blade will dull the teeth and soon 
      make the ruffler useless.</font></p>
