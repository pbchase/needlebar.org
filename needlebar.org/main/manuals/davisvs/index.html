    <h4><font color="#CC0000">GENERAL DIRECTIONS</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Before the machine leaves the factory, 
      it has been carefully inspected and adjusted, and tested with various sizes 
      of thread, and found to work perfectly in every respect.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Never run the machine with the presser 
      foot resting on the feed, and no cloth between, as the sharp teeth of the 
      feed would injure the foot and the feed teeth will be dulled.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Never run the machine with the race 
      covers open, except to turn the wheel very slowly by hand, or the shuttle 
      will catch and cause serious injury to the machine.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Practice on strips of cloth and do 
      not attempt practical sewing until you can guide the material and produce 
      a regular motion.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Do not try to help the feed by pulling 
      the work lest you bend the needle. The machine will feed without assistance.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Do not run the machine when threaded 
      up unless there is cloth under the presser foot, or the thread will snarl 
      and tangle, and perhaps bend or break the needle.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Do not allow lint or dust to accumulate 
      in the shuttle or under the shuttle tension spring, as any substance inside 
      the shuttle will prevent the proper action of the bobbin, or under the spring 
      will interfere with the tension.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">To turn a corner, stop the machine 
      with the needle half way in the work, raise the presser foot, and turn the 
      work, using the needle as a pivot.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">When ordering needles, shuttles or 
      parts of any kind always give the plate number of the machine stamped on 
      the upper side of front race cover or slide directly in front of the needle.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">OILING THE MACHINE</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">One of the most important points 
      in the use of a sewing machine, is keeping it thoroughly oiled, as care 
      in oiling insures ease of motion and prevents wear. Use nothing but the 
      best quality of oil.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Each place requiring oil is indicated 
      by the word &quot;oil&quot; with dotted lines running to the point where 
      oil must be applied. Oil holes will be found for all the bearings which 
      cannot be reached without them.</font></p>
    <p><b><img src="01.jpg" width="784" height="538"></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">To oil the parts inside the head: 
      Raise the needle bar to its highest point, put one drop of oil in each of 
      the oil holes in the bed plate and arm, as indicated.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">To oil the under part of the machine: 
      Throw off the belt, turn back the head on its hinges and apply oil at each 
      bearing point.</font></p>
    <p><b><img src="02.jpg" width="720" height="490"></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The places on the stand requiring 
      oil, are the journal of balance wheel, the bearing each end of pitman, and 
      the bearings of the treadle on each side.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">After oiling run the machine swiftly 
      several revolutions, to distribute the oil and then wipe carefully. Be sure 
      that every part is clean before commencing to sew.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">If the machine runs hard, it is certain 
      that some bearing is not properly oiled. If the machine is gummed from poor 
      oil, or from long standing, use a little kerosene or benzine which will 
      soon remove the gum. Then run the machine rapidly, wipe clean and oil thoroughly 
      with good sewing machine oil.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">THREADING THE MACHINE</font></h4>
    <p><b><font color="#660000">(See Fig. 1)</font></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">First raise the needle bar to its 
      highest point. Place the spool of thread on the spool pin; draw the thread 
      through the hook &quot;A&quot; and down between the tension discs &quot;B&quot;; 
      then up under the hook &quot;C&quot;, up through the takeup eye &quot;D&quot;; 
      then back of the staple &quot;E&quot; in the face plate, drawing the thread 
      forward through the staple; then through the hook on the needle clamp &quot;F&quot;; 
      then through the eye of the needle, leaving the thread about three inches 
      long. </font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">TO THREAD THE SHUTTLE</font></h4>
    <p><b><img src="03.jpg" width="532" height="222"></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Hold the shuttle in the left hand, 
      with the point toward you; drop the bobbin into the shuttle so that the 
      thread draws from the left side of the bobbin as it is put in; then draw 
      the thread into the open slot B toward you, at the same time putting a little 
      pressure with your finger on the bobbin, so that it can not turn; the thread 
      will then be forced under the point T of the shuttle spring. The shuttle 
      is then ready of use.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The shuttle tension is tightened 
      by means of the screw with the small screw driver - turn this screw to the 
      right to increase and to the left to diminish the tension on the thread.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">When the machine leaves the factory, 
      the tension in the shuttle has been set right for all ordinary kinds of 
      work and thread, and therefore needs no alteration. The bore of the shuttle 
      should be kept clear of lint so the end of the bobbin does not project outside 
      the shuttle.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">TO PLACE SHUTTLE IN THE MACHINE</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Withdraw the front race cover and 
      place the shuttle in the carrier with the point toward the operator; then 
      close the slide. It is sometimes more convenient to withdraw the back race 
      cover and put the shuttle in its place when the carrier is at the back part 
      of the race. This is especially the case when some of the attachments are 
      in place.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">THE SHUTTLE RACE</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The face of the shuttle race must 
      be kept clean and free from dirt or gum. To do this, rub occasionally with 
      a piece of cloth having a drop of oil on. Afterwards wipe it with a dry, 
      clean cloth. If through neglect the race has become very gummy, first clean 
      it with a cloth saturated with kerosene, then use an oiled cloth, and a 
      dry, clean cloth as above. The cotton waste in the oil well in shuttle race 
      should be kept well saturated with oil. Breaking of thread and skipping 
      of stitches are frequently caused by failing to keep the shuttle race clean.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">WINDING BOBBINS</font></h4>
    <p><b><img src="04.jpg" width="700" height="772"></b></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">The hand wheel friction nut has a right hand thread.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">To loosen the hand wheel pulley for 
      winding the bobbins, hold the hand wheel with the left hand, and with the 
      right hand turn the Friction Nut to the left or toward you as indicated 
      by the arrow on the nut preceding the word &quot;LOOSEN&quot;. When through 
      winding the bobbin tighten the hand wheel pulley so that the machine will 
      operated by turning the &quot;Friction Nut&quot; to the right as indicated 
      by the arrow preceding the word &quot;TIGHTEN&quot;.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">After loosening the pulley, draw 
      the spooler whirl rubber (H) in contact with the rim of the hand wheel (P) 
      by turning the Thumb Screw (R) to the right just far enough to cause the 
      bobbin winder to operate.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Place one end of the bobbin in the 
      socket of the revolving spindle (K) on the right side and the other end 
      in the socket of the step (L) on the left. Place the end of the thread between 
      the brass head of the bobbin and spindle socket (K) on the right side. Draw 
      the thread through the slot (J) on the end of the distributing lever, then 
      down under hook (N) at the lower end of the lever. Hold the thread between 
      the thumb and forefinger as illustrated, but NOT TOO TIGHT. A minute drop 
      of oil should be placed on the left end of the bobbin (L) and the spindle 
      should be oiled through the oil hole (O). An evenly and smoothly wound bobbin 
      is necessary for good work. Do not wind the bobbin too full, if so it will 
      not revolve freely in the shuttle.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">When the bobbin is wound, back the 
      bobbin winder rubber from the hand wheel by turning the thumb screw (R) 
      to the left and tighten the &quot;Friction Nut&quot; as instructed above 
      and the machine is ready to sew.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">SETTING THE NEEDLE</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Raise the needle bar to its highest 
      point; hold the needle between the thumb and first finger of the left hand, 
      pass the shank up into the groove in the needle bar as far as it will go, 
      with the flat side toward the bar. Secure the needle firmly with the needle 
      clamp screw.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">If Linen, Silk or very coarse Cotton 
      is to be used, the needle may be set a little lower than the directions 
      indicate.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">BREAKING OF NEEDLES</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">If the needle breaks, it is more 
      than likely your own fault, caused by pulling the goods to or from you, 
      or in such a manner that the needle strikes the throat plate, and is bound 
      to break. The needle may, however, break in trying to sew extremely heavy 
      seams when the pressure on the presser foot is not heavy enough. To create 
      more pressure upon the goods, turn the nut on top of the presser bar to 
      the right; to decrease the pressure, turn it to the left. A blunt or hooked 
      point needle will cause trouble and bad work.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><font color="#CC0000">TO ALTER LENGTH OF STITCH</font></h4>
    <p><b><font color="#660000">(See Fig. 4)</font></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The stitch regulator indicator is 
      on the bed plate in front of the base of arm. On the stitch regulator plate 
      will be found a scale of numbers indicating the length of stitch or the 
      number of stitches to the inch (from 7 to 24). To change the stitch, loosen 
      the thumb nut (S) (Figure 4), by turning to the left and slide the point 
      to the figure indicating the length of stitch desired. No. 7 gives the longest 
      and No. 24 the shortest stitch. When the indicator point is placed at (O) 
      the feed is turned entirely off and the machine will refuse to sew.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Any desired length of stitch can 
      be obtained by setting the indicator point at or between the figures on 
      the indicator plate.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Be sure to set the nut tight when 
      the desired length of stitch has been obtained.</font></p>
