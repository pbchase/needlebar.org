  as per illustration on the wrapper</font>.</h3>
<p align="justify"> If the machine has come to you packed in a case unmounted, 
  proceed as follows: -- Take the cross-brace and pass the 2 thinnest bolts through 
  the holes beneath, in order to place the treadle bet- ween these bolts. If the 
  treadle works easily fasten the bolts with the two square screws. Take the 2 
  legs -- gilt sides outwards -- and fix them to the cross-bar on the right and 
  left side by means of 4 conical bolts, passing them through the 2 hind upper 
  holes and the 2 under holes of the legs in front and through the 4 holes of 
  tbe cross-brace; then fasten the 4 bolts by means of the nuts. 
<p align="justify">In order to put the wheel in its position, fix the crank in 
  the hub of the wheel by means of a square screw. loosen the bolt, in the middle 
  of the cross-brace and put the pointed axle of the whee1 into the middle of 
  the right leg. Fee that the wheel moves easily and fasten the said bolt by means 
  of the square screw. See that the wooden rod is <font color="#CC3333">plumb</font>. 
  Put the table loose on the stand and fasten the head of the machine to the table 
  by its hinges. Adjust the table nicely, so that the belt will run clear. through 
  the holes, and try it. Then screw the table from below to the. stand. Oil carefully, 
  drive very fast aud see that everything runs easily.

<h4 align="center"><font color="#660000">TO ERECT THE MACHINE</font></h4>
<p align="justify">. If the Machine has come to you packed in a case, stand unmounted, 
  proceed as fellows: -- Take the treadle-rod and pass one and through the hole 
  in the right leg and the other end through the left of the stand. Keep the gilt 
  sides of the legs outwards. Screw the nuts on loosely. Put the cross brace in 
  position as shown in the engraving, leaving the right side loose, so that you 
  may fit the wheel in its place. To do this, you must first insert the pointed 
  screw through the right leg, firmly fixing it with the nut outside. Then screw 
  all the bolts tight. Screw the wooden pitman to the wheel and to the treadle, 
  but not so tight as to make it run heavily. Fix the treadle with the conical 
  nuts so that while it works easily it cannot shake about. See that the wooden 
  rod is <font color="#CC3333">plumb</font>. Put the table loose on the stand 
  and fasten the <font color="#CC3333">head</font> of the machine to the table 
  by its hinges. Adjust the table nicely so that the belt will run clear through 
  the holes, and try it. Then screw the table from below to the stand. Oil carefully, 
  drive very fast and see that everything runs easily. 

<p align="justify">EVERY "Naumann" Machine, before leaving the Factory, is carefully 
  tested. It will stitch with No. 300 cotton, or with coarse 9-cord thread, and 
  is competent to perform all the kinds of work set forth in our circulars. As 
  an evidence of this it is send out threaded, and with a piece of work under 
  the needle. 
<p align="justify">Examine the threading of machine and shuttle carefully, which 
  is clearly shown in our illustrations. 
<h4 align="center"> <font color="#660000">To put the Machine in Gear for Working<img src="diag01.jpg" width="225" height="350" align="right"></font></h4>
<p align="justify"> THE upper fly-wheel of every machine is disconnected before 
  it leaves our Depot, so that no harm can happen to it in transit. Turn the steel 
  connector "b" on the outside of the upper wheel <font color="#CC3333">inwards</font>. 
<p align="justify"> To put it <font color="#CC3333">out</font> of gear turn the 
  connector <font color="#CC3333">outwards</font>. 
<h4 align="center"> <font color="#660000">To operate the Patent Rollers</font></h4>
<p align="justify">TILT the machine <font color="#CC3333">from</font> you, when 
  the rollers will drop to the floor for use. Raise the light end of the machine 
  and run it where you like. When about to sew, the machine will rest firm, which 
  will be a great advantage to you. 
<h4 align="center"><font color="#660000">To oil the Machine</font></h4>
<p align="justify"> <font color="#CC3333">THIS most important duty ought to be 
  closely attended to</font>. Neglect will bring trouble and dissatisfaction and 
  we will not be held responsible for the consequences. You should only use <font color="#CC3333">best 
  quality Sewing-machine Oil</font>, which is always obtainable at our agencies. 
  Never (except for cleaning as explained on next page and then only moderately 
  and for a few minutes) use kerosene, petroleum or paraffin, which corrode the 
  works. Salad-oil, olive, castor or any other coarse oil, are certain to clog 
  the machine, cause it to run heavily and in the end stops it altogether. 
<p align="justify"> Look into the openings on the outside of' the upper wheel. 
  You will see a red line, indicating in oil-hole. Into this and into all others 
  holes painted red pour a few drops of oil. On the top of the arm are two oil-holes 
  No. 4 to the right and No. R to the left- Push the silvered plate No. 5 in front 
  arm near the fly wheel to the left; you will then see the cog-wheels, which 
  oil, and also the shaft which bears them. Put oil upon all parts of the machine 
  subject to constant friction for instance the needle-bar 45, the presser bar 
  8, through the hole in the face plate. 
<p align="justify"> Should the machine be supplied with a hand appliance put some 
  drops of oil in the 2 holes in the frame and also in the crank. 
<p align="justify">Now throw off the belt, turn up the head of the machine (refer 
  to fig. 2 on the inside back cover) and oil <font color="#CC3333">all moving 
  parts</font> carefully, turning the wheel slowly that you may see them. Do not 
  forget to look behind the revolving eccentric on the right <font color="#CC3333">a</font>. 
  Oil this. Also both ends of the long rod <font color="#CC3333">b</font> and 
  <font color="#CC3333">c</font>, the slide of the shuttle carrier <font color="#CC3333">h</font> 
  and the part that moves the feeder <font color="#CC3333">g</font>. 
<p align="justify"> Oil all the bearings of the stand carefully and when taking 
  off the belt of the wheel, see that it runs easily. 
<p align="justify"> The machine will need cleaning from time to time, especially 
  if only occasionally used. To do this pour kerosene or petroleum upon all the 
  moving parts and drive very fast for a minute only. <font color="#CC3333">Then 
  thoroughly wipe off the dirty kerosene or petroleum</font>. Then oil throughout 
  as above directed. 
<p align="center"><img src="Naumann04.jpg" width="600" height="319">
<p align="justify"> It is a simple plan and. a good one to keep a soft rag for 
  the purpose of cleaning the wearing parts every Ray (if used constantly) before 
  commencing work. Then oil the machine as directed, using only a few drops in 
  each place. This will only take but a few moments which are well repaid. 
<p align="center"> <b><font color="#CC3333">If the machine runs stiffly he sure 
  it is your own fault. It is either dirty, or you have not oiled some part.</font></b>
<h4 align="center"> <font color="#660000">The Treadle Motion</font></h4>
<p align="justify"> IF the operator is unused to sewing machines she should first 
  become familiar with the treadle motion. Place the feet in an easy position 
  on the treadle, so that the hollow of the foot may rest directly over the treadle 
  rod. Start the wheel with the right hand by <font color="#CC3333">turning it 
  towards you</font>, then by giving the ankle an easy, rocking motion, regularity 
  and evenness will be obtainable to the operator's best advantage. 
<h4 align="center"> <font color="#660000">Important Advice</font></h4>
<p align="justify"> IN the event of any breakage or disarrangement by accident, 
  which seldom happens, please send the machine to one of our nearest agencies 
  where the matter will be put right and with fair usage the machine will last 
  your lifetime. 
<p align="justify"> <font color="#CC3333">Do not allow any person to interfere 
  with the mechanism in any way</font>. Do not alter the main screws or the adjustment. 
  Do not allow any clever friend to file, or mark or to tinker any part of the 
  machine. We have often heard a customer saying:,I took my machine all to pieces 
  and put it together again." Nothing is so bad. <font color="#CC3333">Let well 
  alone</font>. 
<h3 align="center"><font color="#660000">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ </font></h3>
<h4 align="center"><font color="#660000">Setting the Needle</font></h4>
<p align="justify"> LOOSEN the screw 28 on the needle-clamp, first moving the 
  needle- bar to, its highest point. Put the butt end of the needle in the clamp, 
  keeping the side with the <font color="#CC3333">long groove towards you</font>. 
  Lower the needle-bar <font color="#CC3333">until the gauge-mark</font> (a graven 
  line) <font color="#CC3333">on the upper part of the bar is exactly level with 
  the top of the machine. Then see that the eye of the needle comes exactly level 
  with the needle-plate</font>. Screw the needle-clamp tight. It will however 
  be found that the needles supplied with the family machine are self setting 
  and. invariably require to be simply pushed as high as they will go when they 
  will be found in the right position without reference to the graven line aforesaid. 
  See that the needle moves precisely in the centre of the hole in the needle-plate, 
  If the needle be slightly bent, spring it with the finger until it be quite 
  straight. <font color="#CC3333">If you neglect to set the needle properly you 
  will break the thread or miss stitches</font>. 
<h4 align="center"> <font color="#660000">Size of Needle and Thread</font></h4>
<p align="justify"> WITH the "Naumann" Machines you do not require so coarse a 
  thread as in hand-sewing, every stitch being <font color="#CC3333">double,</font> 
  and, moreover, <font color="#CC3333">locked</font>. Be careful and see that 
  you have the needle adjusted to a given size for the thread to pass through 
  viz. 
<p align="center"> <b><font color="#660000">For 200 to 150 Cotton use No. 9 (or 
  00) Needle</font></b>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><b>For 150 to 100 Cotton use No.10 (or 
  0) Needle</b></font>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><b> For 100 to 80 Cotton use No.11 (or 
  1) Needle</b></font>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><b> For 80 to 60 Cotton use No.12 (or 
  2) Needle</b></font>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><b> For 60 to 40 Cotton use No.18 (or 
  8) Needle</b></font>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><b> For 40 to 80 Cotton use No.14 (or 
  4) Needle</b></font>
<p align="center"><font color="#660000"><b> For 80 to 20 Cotton use No.15 (or 
  5) Needle</b></font>
