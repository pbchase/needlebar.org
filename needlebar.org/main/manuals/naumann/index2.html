<h4 align="center"><font color="#660000">PATENT AUTOMATIC DOUBLE ACTION BOBBIN-WINDER</font></h4>
<p align="justify">. HAVING placed the reel on one of the spindles, on the top 
  of the arm of the machine, pass the cotton upwards through the wire eyelet (by 
  simply slipping it into it from the back) then over and between the tension 
  discs (c), down towards the winder from behind and under its shoulder-bar towards 
  yourself. Then, take the bobbin in your right hand, and having threaded the 
  cotton through the little hole in one of its brass ends, place the bobbin in 
  the winder by fitting the little hole through which you have just passed the 
  cotton into the corresponding pin in the right-hand socket of the winder; then 
  place the other side of the bobbin in its position into the left- hand socket, 
  to do which you require to draw out the left-hand piston-button, until you can 
  drop the bobbin into both its sockets. 
<p align="justify"> Having now the bobbin properly threaded and in its proper 
  position, press the little lever <font color="#CC3333">(a)</font> under the 
  thread pressure-plate, which will cause the latter to spring flat against the 
  bobbin; a second pressure against <font color="#CC3333">"b"</font> will bring 
  the India rubber ring in contact with the fly wheel. Disconnect the fly wheel 
  and put it in motion and the bobbin will begin to fill and will throw itself 
  out of action when full. Should the winder be thrown out of action before the 
  bobbin is full enough, or only when the bobbin is too full, the defect either 
  way can be regulated by means of the screw f on the lever d. It is advisable 
  to regulate the screw f so, that the bobbin is not allowed to wind too full, 
  otherwise it is apt to jam in the shuttle. Should the bobbin be only required 
  to be partly fi11ed, the winder can be thrown out of action by simply pressing 
  on the little lever (d) at the bottom of the left-hand side. Should the India- 
  rubber wheel touch the fly wheel too firmly or not firm enough, the slightest 
  turn of the screw e under the winder and facing the operator, will regulate 
  a proper tension between the two wheels.

<h4 align="center"><font color="#660000"> OUTSIDE SPRING </font></h4>
<p align="center"><img src="diag03.jpg" width="550" height="318"> 
<p align="justify">Hold the shuttle in the left hand, point towards yourself, 
  and the bobbin in the right. Place one end of bobbin in the centre piston in 
  point of shuttle, pressing bobbin down into the hole on the other end until 
  it makes a slight, click". 
<p align="justify"> The cotton must come from <font color="#CC3333">under the 
  bobbin</font> on the bar-side of shuttle. 
<p align="justify"> Now proceed to thread the shuttle as illustrated above. Take 
  the cotton and pass the same round circle <font color="#CC3333">A</font> in 
  end of shuttle, after which it will be seen to be round the bar; next take cotton 
  across shuttle, pass it through groove into the hole <font color="#CC3333">B</font>, 
  and then by drawing cotton gently towards point of shuttle, it will pass under 
  the spring to point <font color="#CC3333">C</font>, as shewn in the illustration 
  above, when it is ready for use. 
<p align="justify"> By drawing cotton to the right after it is threaded, i.e., 
  away from the point, the tension of the shuttle can be tested -- whether too 
  tight or <i>vice versa</i>. A small screw-driver is supplied with the shuttle 
  for the purpose of regulating the tension by the screw <font color="#CC3333">F</font>; 
  by turning screw to the right the tension is tightened, and to the left, the 
  tension is loosened. 
<p align="justify"> Care should be taken to <font color="#CC3333">oil both ends 
  of the bobbin</font> when it is fixed in the shuttle ready for work, in order 
  that the same revolves freely.

<h4 align="center"> <font color="#660000">Hand-Machine</font></h4>
<h3 align="center"> <font color="#660000">"SAXONIA REGIA"</font></h3>
<p align="justify"> BEFORE you begin to spool throw the fly wheel out of gear 
  by pushing the connector (<font color="#CC3333">47</font>) away from you as 
  far as it will go. 
<p align="justify"> Then pass the cotton into the right hand slot <font color="#CC3333">(b)</font> 
  of the thread guide round and between the discs into the left hand slot <font color="#CC3333">(a)</font> 
  down towards and under the steel bar <font color="#CC3333">(c)</font> to the 
  bobbin; thread up the bobbin and put it so threaded in position precisely as 
  described. (in this book) for the other winder. To put the winder in gear, press 
  the shoulder bar <font color="#CC3333">(h)</font> against the arm of the machine 
  when the little cog wheel attached to the spooler on the right will grip the 
  cogs of the fly wheel. To disconnect the spooler simply press on the flat button 
  <font color="#CC3333">(e)</font> 
<p align="justify"> The screw <font color="#CC3333">f </font>serves to regulate 
  the position of the winder cog in connection with the fly wheel cog; if they 
  do not meet sufficiently near to each other turn the screw <font color="#CC3333">f</font> 
  to the left, if they are too close turn the screw <font color="#CC3333">f</font> 
  to the right. The screw <font color="#CC3333">g</font> simply serves to steady 
  the regulation arrived at by the screw <font color="#CC3333">f</font> and should 
  always be screwed firmly against the rim of the bed plate. 
<p align="center"><img src="diag04.jpg" width="467" height="497"> 
<h4 align="center"><font color="#660000">Commencing to Sew</font></h4>
<p align="justify"> PLACE the material under the presser-foot (18), lower the 
  presser- bar with the aid of handle 15, drive the machine fast or slow, as you 
  may desire, but at a regular and even pace. If you want extra pressure for thick 
  material, screw the nut on the top 18 of the presser-bar <font color="#CC3333">downwards</font>. 
  If you want less pressure for fine and delicate materials, screw the nut <font color="#CC3333">upwards</font>. 
  <font color="#CC3333">Do not pull or push</font> the work through the machine; 
  you will break needles and make bad work by doing so. The machine will feed 
  quite regularly by itself. ln crossing thick places, or in seams, go slower, 
  and if necessary, when a great thickness occurs, raise the presser-foot slightly. 
<h4 align="center"> <font color="#660000">To take out the Material</font></h4>
<p align="justify">RAISE the needle-bar to its highest point aud then the presser-foot 
  by means of the lifter (15). Draw the work out from you to the left and cut 
  the threads leaving about three inches in order to be long enough to start afresh. 
<h4 align="center"><font color="#660000">The Tension</font></h4>
<p align="justify"> TO adjust the upper tension turn the little thumb-screw No. 
  16 on the top of the machine slightly to the right to tighten the tension, and 
  to the left to loosen it. The stitch is most perfect when it appears alike on 
  both sides. If the thread forms loops underneath the fabric the upper tension 
  is too loose. The "Naumann" machine is so designed that very little alteration 
  of tension is needed. Fix it right once, and then you may mostly let it alone. 
<h4 align="center"><font color="#660000">The Stitch Regulator</font> </h4>
<p align="justify">is the thumb screw 20 on the right of the machine. To lengthen 
  the stitch loosen the screw and slide it to the <font color="#CC3333">right</font>; 
  to shorten it, slide the screw to the <font color="#CC3333">left</font>. <font color="#CC3333">When 
  adjusted always re-tighten the screw</font>. 
<h3 align="center"><b><font color="#660000">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font></b></h3>
<p align="justify"> THE SLACK-THREAD-PIN (12) presses down the check-lever (6). 
  It is adjusted properly for all classes of general sewing, <font color="#CC3333">and 
  should never he altered</font> unless the thread breaks in sewing very thick 
  cloth; then loosen the screw (12) and adjust the slack-thread-pin a bit lower 
  but very little. Should it become displaced, re-adjust it, according to the 
  following rule: -- <font color="#CC3333">It should begin to press down the check-lever 
  when the needle-gauge mark is fully one eighth of an inch above the top of the 
  arm.</font> 
<p align="justify">THE CHECK- SPRING (2) draws up check- lever (6). Should it 
  break or wear out, insert another as follows; let the needle - bar (45) rest 
  when the gaugemark is level with the top of the arm, take out the screw that 
  holds the spring, draw the check lever out half way, holding it while you put 
  in the spring <font color="#CC3333">with its hook end downward</font>, then 
  move the check-lever back into its place. Replace the screw, by turning it a 
  few times only, press down the end of the spring into the first hole (or into 
  the second or third hole, if using coarse thread) and tighten the screw. 
<p align="justify">THE LEATHER BAND must be tight enough to work the machine without 
  slipping. If it is too loose, cut about half an inch from one end and refasten 
  is as before with the strap hook. 
<p align="justify"> IF THE NEEDLE-THREAD BREAKS <font color="#CC3333">when the 
  needle is adjusted properly</font>, it is caused by the tension being too tight, 
  the eye of the needle being too small, the slack-thread-pin becoming displaced 
  (see Note above), a roughness on the shuttle or its carrier, or sometimes, when 
  using coarse silk, by the point of the needle being bent. The stitch plate is 
  also sometimes the cause of its breaking, if not rightly screwed up; the needle 
  has to move freely in the centre of the needlehole and not to touch the shuttle. 
<p align="justify"> IF THE SHUTTLE-THREAD BREAKS, loosen the tension by the screw 
  in the hole <font color="#CC3333">F</font>. (See page 6 "Threading the Shuttle&quot;) 
<p align="justify"> IF THERE ARE MISSED STITCHES, they are caused by the needle 
  being adjusted too high or too low, <font color="#CC3333">by it being bent away 
  from the shuttle</font>, it being too small for the thread or by the point of 
  the shuttle having become blunt, if the machine is dirty and not well oiled 
  so that is has not a regular motion, if the long groove of the needle is not 
  exactly' placed towards the operator or even stands towards the shuttle. 
<p align="justify"> IF THE NEEDLE-THREAD FORMS SMALL LOOPS on the top of the fabric, 
  it is caused by the check-spring <font color="#CC3333">(2)</font> having become 
  broken (see page 8:, The Check-Spring"), and sometimes, when sewing whit coarse 
  silk or linen thread, by the needle being too fine or its point being bent. 
<p align="justify"> IF THE STITCHES VARY IN LENGTH while hemming or sewing very 
  thick and soft fabrics, loosen the feed raising cam <font color="#CC3333">(e)</font> 
  and move it a little to the right to raise the feed-points, then tighten it 
  firmly', do not raise the feed-points too high: when they drop down in working, 
  they should be a little below the surface of the needle-plate. 
<p align="justify"> SEAMS IN HARD COTTON FABRICS should be passed over slowly, 
  and, if extra thick, rub a little white soap on them, which will facilitate 
  the passage of the needle.
