          the shuttle in the left hand and raise the tension spring latch <b>A</b> 
          with the first finger of the right hand. Hold the bobbin or reel so 
          that the thread will draw off from the underside as illustrated. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, place 
          one end of the reel into the small hole <b>B </b>at the heel or back 
          end of the shuttle, and drop the other end into the small slot <b>C 
          </b>at the point of the shuttle. Pass the thread round the point or 
          end of the bar <b>D</b>, be careful that the thread pulls from the bottom 
          side of the Reel, thence through the slot in the tension spring latch 
          <b>A</b>. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now drop 
          the spring latch into the position, as illustrated; care being taken 
          to keep the end of the thread tight whilst putting the spring down, 
          so that the thread may not snarl or knot between the spring latch and 
          the side of the shuttle. Pass the thread through slot <b>F</b> to the 
          outer side of the shuttle and draw it under the spring.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the 
          shuttle is threaded, before you put it into the machine, <b>ALWAYS PUT 
          ONE DROP OF OIL ON THE FACE OF THE SHUTTLE. </b>It causes the Machine 
          to run easy and smoothly, and the shuttle will last three times as long.</font></p></td>

  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#CC0000">TO 
    REGULATE THE SHUTTLE TENSION</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tension may 
    be regulated and varied to the greatest nicety by turning the <i>Tension Screw</i><b><i> 
    </i>E</b> either backward or forward, so as to force the tension spring latch 
    against the thread which lies between the spring and the side of the shuttle, 
    and thereby increase or diminish the tension as desired. By turning the shuttle 
    tension screw <b>E </b>to the right, you increase or tighten the tension. 
    By turning the shuttle tension screw <b>E</b> to the left, you decrease or 
    slacken the tension. Care should be taken not to turn the screw <b>E</b> too 
    far back, or it will project beyond the side of shuttle, and break the cotton 
    as the shuttle passes through the loop of the upper thread. Where is no other 
    shuttle in existence that possesses so beautiful and even a tension.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE: </b>The 
    shuttle Tension SCREW is split at the end, so that if it wears slack you have 
    simply to take the Screw out of the shuttle, and insert the blade of a knife 
    into the slot, so as to open out the Screw, and thus make it fit into the 
    shuttle as tight as when new.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#CC0000">TO 
    COMMENCE SEWING</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Raise the presser 
    foot by pulling the lifter <b>F</b> to the right; withdraw the slide that 
    covers the shuttle race, and place the shuttle into the shuttle-carrier, leaving 
    about two inches of thread stretched out behind. Then let the needle descend 
    (putting the finger on the end of the thread). The shuttle will then pass 
    through the loop of the needle thread, and when the needle rises it will bring 
    the shuttle thread up with it through the needle-hole in cloth-plate. Then 
    close the slide, place the fabric under the needle, and let the presser-foot 
    down upon it. Be sure that the presser-foot rests upon the fabric before commencing 
    to sew. There must be some tension upon the threads, otherwise they will know 
    or tangle up. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#CC0000">THE 
    TENSIONS</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tension should 
    be so regulated as to draw both threads and lock them together in the centre 
    of the fabric, thus: <img src="tension-1.jpg" width="150" height="39" align="absmiddle"> producing 
    a firm, neat, and durable <b>Lock-Stitch</b>, which will neither rip nor ravel, 
    but has the same appearance on both sides of the material when sewn, if both 
    threads are of proper size, and have the right amount of tension upon them.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the shuttle 
    thread is very tight and the upper thread too loose, the under thread will 
    be straight, thus: <img src="tension-2.jpg" width="146" height="45" align="absmiddle">because 
    there is not sufficient upper tension to draw the under thread in. On the 
    other hand, if the shuttle thread draws off too easily, and the upper is too 
    tight, the under thread will be drawn up through the fabric, and the upper 
    thread will lie straight, thus: <img src="tension-2.jpg" width="146" height="45" align="absmiddle"> 
    while the under side may look well. The stitch should be made perfect on both 
    sides. It is therefore necessary to have the tension of both threads as nearly 
    alike as possible, and as tight as the threads will sew without breaking. 
    The upper tension can be increased or lessened at pleasure by turning the 
    tension thumb nut <b>H</b>; the lower tension by turning the screw in shuttle 
    to right or left.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TO REMOVE THE 
    WORK</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Note the New 
    Thread Releasing Arrangement, an Important Improvement in this Machine.</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When removing the 
    work from under the machine, immediately you lift the presser bar foot lifter 
    you will find that the thread or cotton in the tension is released, and you 
    can draw the work from under the machine easily without breaking the thread 
    or needle. It is always necessary to leave a few inches of cotton or thread 
    when you cut off the work.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#CC0000">TO 
    REGULATE THE LENGTH OF STITCH</font></b></font></p>

      <td width="36%"> <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 
          turning the thumb screw <b>G </b>to the left hand, the stitch will be 
          lengthened. By turning the thumb screw <b>G </b>to the right hand, the 
          stitch will be shortened. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE: 
          </b>- Be careful not to turn the thumb screw <b>G</b> too much to the 
          right hand, or you will stop the feed from acting and carrying the work 
          forward.</font></p></td>

  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#CC0000">MISSED 
    STITCHES</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are caused by the 
    needle being too high or too low, or the cotton being too fine for the needle, 
    or the needle point being blunt or damaged.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the thread is 
    improperly twisted, it may throw the loop towards one side, instead of square 
    into the shuttle race. In that case the needle should be slightly turned in 
    an opposite direction, to counteract this tendency to throw the loop away 
    from its proper position.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When using very 
    fine needles, and also when stitching heavy work, be sure that the point of 
    the needle is perfect, sharp, and not blunted or turned over.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important 
    the needle point is <b>SHARP.</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>An imperfect 
    needle may cause the best Machine to miss stitches.</b></font></p>

  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#CC0000">BREAKING 
    OF THREAD OR COTTON</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is caused by the 
    needle being put into the Machine with the short groove on the wrong side:</font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or if the needle 
    is set too high or too low;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or by the tension 
    being too tight; </font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or by the thread 
    being too large for needle eye;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or if the needle 
    eye be rough or sharp.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Be sure that the 
    hole in the needle plate is not rough or damaged but perfectly smooth.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the hole in 
    the needle plate is rough, it is sure to cause the Machine to cut and break 
    the thread.</font></p>
