  <p><strong><font color="#0000FF" size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">by Les Godfrey</font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>Just like the sewing machine, 
    the needle has undergone many years of continuous development.  Was the first 
    needle made from a bone or a sharp stick?  Whatever the answer the first obvious 
    improvement was a hole cut into one end allowing sinew to be threaded through 
    hides and such.  With this simple device we have the two main features of 
    today’s hand sewing needle, possibly one of man’s earliest tools.  The needle 
    continued its development along with the invention of the sewing machine.  
    In </span></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>fact, it is fair 
    to say that the two evolved together.  The major breakthrough came when the 
    hole (eye) moved down to the point, an essential characteristic in the achievement of 
    a working machine capable of producing either a lockstitch or a chain stitch.        
    </span></font></p> </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>The needle is 
    an integral part of the sewing process.  Obvious you say, but consider this. Not 
    only is the needle there to pass the thread through the fabric, it is also 
    part of the stitch construction mechanism. </span></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>A 
    needle is made up of several parts each as important as the other. Starting 
    at the top we have the shank, the thick end.  Early needles were usually the 
    same thickness from top to bottom and the thicker shank was incorporated to 
    strengthen the needle as speeds increased and heavier fabrics needed to be 
    sewn.  Depending on the needle system (type of needle) and there are a couple 
    of thousand,  the shank will either have a flat side or be completely round.  
    Most domestic sewing machines now use a needle with a flat-sided shank, it 
    is this feature that positions the needle correctly in the sewing machine 
    ensuring it faces the right way.  Next is the long groove, which runs from 
    the shank down to the eye.  This groove is at the front of the needle and 
    is opposite the flat on the shank.  At the end of the groove is the eye followed 
    by the point. Believe it or not there are different eyes and points.  Above 
    the  eye at the back of the needle, opposite the groove, is the scarf - a 
    short indent or concaved surface. Some needles have a second short groove 
    or perhaps other components but those listed above are the main features.  
    All of these components have an important function in forming the stitch. </span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>See illustration. 
    </span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS"> <span lang=EN-US>    <img src="image.gif" width="371" height="168" hspace="50"></span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>The stitch formation 
    takes place in this order: the needlepoint must first penetrate the fabric 
    allowing the eye to carry the thread through the fabric. The fabric in turn 
    pushes the thread into the long groove. The groove holds the thread tight 
    at the front of the needle as the needle descends. When the needle reaches 
    its lowest position, called bottom dead centre, it starts to rise. This causes 
    the thread to throw a loop at the rear,  opposite the groove. This happens 
    because the thread is being held by the groove at the front. This loop forms 
    at the scarf, which is fundamental to the stitch formation allowing the hook 
    to pick up the thread.</span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>Now that you 
    are aware of these design rules what if you unintentionally put the needle into 
    the machine back to front?  A direct result would be the loop forming on the 
    wrong side of the needle for the hook to pick up, resulting in mis-stitching, 
    tangling and possible thread breakage.  The needle is indeed an integral part 
    of the sewing process and therefore must be fitted correctly.                                  
           </span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>The needle height 
    is also critical.  When the needle is fitted into the needle clamp it must be 
    pushed up all the way until it touches the stop.  If on an older machine there 
    is no needle stop the needle height must be set, usually by way of a guide 
    line on the needle bar.  The needle bar is raised so that the guide line is 
    level with the top of the machine casting and at this point the needle is 
    set (tightened) so that the eye is level with the needle plate.  If a guide 
    line is not visible set the needle height by the shuttle.  Check the height 
    of the needle when the shuttle point is directly behind the needle, it should  be 
    approximately one eye height above the eye.  </span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>Another important 
    element is the correct thread size, in relation to the needle.  A thread that 
    is too thick for the needle will not stay in the long groove or cannot enter 
    the groove</span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>in the first 
    place.    </span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>A blunt or damaged 
    needlepoint can cause a miss stitch by making a bigger hole in the fabric 
    thus not allowing the fabric to push the thread into the groove etc..  The 
    correct needlepoint must also be selected for the fabric e.g., for knitted 
    fabric (stretch) a stretch needle must be used.  A stretch needle does not 
    have a sharp point but rather a rounded   point.  It is this feature which 
    makes it possible to sew knitted fabrics without damaging the fabric which 
    in turn would cause a miss stitch. The rounded point pushes aside the fibre.  
    Importantly it does not cut through the fibre.  If this were to happen and 
    it being a knitted fabric it would cause a run. This run would cause too big 
    a hole to form and this would result in a miss stitch.        </span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>On most modern 
    domestic machines the needle is fitted with the flat side facing towards     
    the back of the sewing machine and is threaded from the front.  Older machines 
    could have the needle fitted either with the flat to the back, left or right.  
    If there is no flat the long groove is the identifying feature and will determine 
    which way the needle must face. The scarf is not always present on early needles.  
    Remember it is the long groove that holds the thread at the front of the needle 
    allowing the loop to form on the correct side, which by necessity is where 
    the hook or shuttle will, if everything else is right, enter the      loop.   
    Determine which way the long groove must face by checking which side of the 
    needle the hook or shuttle will pass.  This must be on the opposite side of 
    the long groove.  The needle is then threaded from the side with the long 
    groove. </span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>If you are wondering 
    about the terminology ‘Hook’ and ‘Shuttle’, generally a Rotary  Hook machine 
    is said to have a Hook and a ‘T.S.’ (Transverse Shuttle).  A ‘V.S.’ (Vibrating 
    Shuttle) type machine is said to have a Shuttle.  To complicate things a little 
    more the C.B. (central bobbin) type machine, e.g. class 15 Singer, is known 
    as a Shuttle Hook or a C.B. Hook.   </span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>There are many 
    reasons for miss stitching but assuming the sewing machine is in perfect mechanical 
    condition it comes down to the correct needle choice and fitting.</span></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>Earlier I mentioned 
    different needlepoints and eyes.  Well there is another element often overlooked 
    - needle size or thickness.  Domestic sewing machine needles are available 
    in sizes  60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120.  Size 100 being 1mm thick, 120 
    being 1.2mm,  down to 60, being 0.6mm of 1 mm.  Therefore, the rule is the 
    larger the number the thicker the needle.  Everyone knows or should realise 
    that a needle size of 100 used in a fine fabric such as chiffon will not only 
    damage the fabric, it will more than likely cause miss stitching.  Remember 
    the groove in the front of the needle?  Well it can only hold the thread tight 
    if the fabric is capable of pushing the thread into it and this can only happen 
    if the hole in the fabric is small enough to grip the needle.  If the thread 
    is not held in the groove at the front of the needle when the needle starts 
    to rise the loop will not form, or a small loop may form on both sides of 
    the needle too small for the hook to pick up.  This will not happen at every 
    stitch, it depends purely on the hole made by the needle.</span></font></p>
  <p align="justify" class=MsoFooter><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>There 
    are numerous mechanical faults that will cause stitch problems, shuttle timing 
    to mention one.  However, what I have attempted to do in this article is unlock 
    the mystery of that dark area below the needle plate.  You should now be able 
    to work out which way the needle must face in your machine and knowing that 
    you also know which way the needle is to be threaded.     </span></font></p>
  <p align="justify" class=MsoFooter><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang=EN-AU>One 
    of man’s earliest tools has come a long way, it has helped clothe us, keeping 
    us warm and dry. In relatively recent times it has kept thousands of people 
    gainfully employed within a vast industry - the textile trade.     </span></font></p>
